5 tips to help get the weight off :: my weight loss journey {#WWSponsored

   â€œThis post was created as part of a relationship in which I was
   sponsored by Weight Watchers and given a free three month subscription
   to try their new Personal Coaching product and write about my
   experience. Though I was compensated for my time and commitment, all
   views, positive and negative, are my own. #WeightWatchers #WWsponsored

   My weight loss has not been substantial at this point. But, thatâ€™s ok.
   I am not in this for quick loss and then gaining it back. I am looking
   for long term, healthy changes in my lifeâ€¦to last me the REST of my
   life. That being said, I wanted to share with you 5 things I have been
   doing to help keep me focused. Help keep me driving towards my goal.
   The goal I set up in my Weight Watchers account and keep watching it on
   a weekly basis!

   I am using [45]Weight Watchers this time around for several reasons,
   however, one of the biggest reasons is because itâ€™s SO. MUCH. MORE.
   than just a diet program. They are humans making me feel even more like
   a better human. The personal coaching is uplifting me, making me feel
   ok when I fail, yet pushing me a little so I can pick up where I left
   off.

   You guys, I love the [46]personal coaching!! {big, puffy heart love!!}

   All right, enough of the mushy, mushy talk, letâ€™s talk about some
   things YOU can do to achieve your weight loss success!!

   Have a scheduled day to weigh in each weekâ€¦same day, same time. You
   wouldnâ€™t think it would make a difference, but it does when it comes to
   the time of day. I always do it first thing in the morning â€“ I go to
   the bathroom, then grab the scale. Clockwork.

   Track, track, and track some more. I donâ€™t know about you, but if I
   know that Iâ€™m going to have to write something down, if itâ€™s going to
   be solidified in black ink in a notebook or in my app, I hesitate to
   eat it. Might seem silly, but YOU try it! If you know that you are
   going to have to add a peanut butter cup to your app, and then itâ€™s
   going to generate automatically the points in which you just consumed,
   Iâ€™m betting you will hesitate to eat it. That tip alone has saved me a
   TON of calories lol!! My tipâ€¦right now you can get a steal on
   calendars. Yes, you can get one that has a hefty price tag on it, and
   to each his own. But, I picked mine up in the dollar section at Target,
   yâ€™all!! Boo-yah!! Itâ€™s perfect because there is space for each day, so
   I can put some food as well as my work-outs. Itâ€™s mainly for my
   work-outs to be honest, I like the Weight Watchers app to track my
   food. :)
   blank pages in your book

   Prep ahead. Itâ€™s hard to plan. Like REALLY hard for me. That has been
   my biggest challenge, and when I donâ€™t plan and prep, I find myself
   grabbing snacks all day longâ€¦nothing of substance and only things that
   will leave me longing for more food. When I DO plan ahead, I have
   healthy snacks and meals all set and ready to roll. I have been trying
   to do this on the weekend, when my husband is around to help monitor
   the children and make sure they are staying safe lol! My advice for you
   is to do it when you can stay focused. I like to sit down at the
   computer and check out the meal section of the Weight Watchers site.
   The meals are FABULOUS and give huge direction. Not every one of them
   is up my alley, but Iâ€™m able to sort and pick from difficult to create
   to easy. I opt for easy 9 times out of 10.

   Have a great support system. Whether itâ€™s your spouse or significant
   other or a family member or a friend. Having someone you can talk to
   about things whenever you need to, is HUGELY important! If you donâ€™t
   have a good support system, that is where I find the PERSONAL COACHING
   is beyond fabulous. I have stuck with the same gal, and I love it. You
   can totally switch it up, but the gal I picked meshes well with me.
   They have a little bio when you are reading about the personal coaches.
   I picked one that was in to running, because when I do workout, the
   food is what gets me. I want to eat everything in sight! I needed
   someone that understood this. Outside of my husband, she is my other
   part of the support system. She lifts me up and points things out that
   I may have not see. Crucial!! Oh yesâ€¦one more thing. Sorry, I keep
   adding, but this is a great point too! There is 24/7 help via the
   Weight Watchers app and online too! Just one click and you are on your
   way to the help or reassurance you need! Weight Watchers Notifications
   via iPhone

   The last thing, just have more good days than bad days. Period. Donâ€™t
   beat yourself up. Work on loving yourself!! Tomorrow is a new day! Make
   better choices tomorrow and you will feel good!!
   make today better than yesterday quote

   So, talk to me. What are your biggest tips? Orâ€¦what are your biggest
   struggles? How are YOU [47]getting healthy this year? Iâ€™d love to chat
   about this!!

       I tried this program a few years ago, I think I might try it again.
       I worked for me before until I had some health issues.

       Just love personal coaches, however I think you may have to check
       out a few different people to make sure that you get a coach that
       fits your style.

       I love having a personal coach, itâ€™s similar to the support of a 12
       step program. Whenever you need help or someone to talk to they
       will be there for you!

       I have always loved WW. I definitely know for me planning is key.
       If I plan ahead I am less likely to eat things I wouldnâ€™t normally
       eat

       This program sounds like it could really work. I will have to check
       into it more for myself.
