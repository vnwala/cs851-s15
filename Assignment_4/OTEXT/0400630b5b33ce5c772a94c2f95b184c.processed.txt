The 10 safest cities in the world

Only one American city cracks the Economist Intelligence Unit's list, and
it's probably not the one you'd expect

   [128]The 10 safest cities in the world (Credit: [129]Shutterstock/Sean
   Pavone)
   This article originally appeared on [130]GlobalPost.

   [131]Global Post Live in a city? Want to find out how safe you are? The
   Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) has got you covered.

   The EIU released its [132]Safe Cities Index 2015 this week, which rates
   50 cities based on how well they do in four safety-related factors:

   1. Digital security — cyber security, privacy, safety from identity
   theft

   2. Health security — cost and quality of health services, environment
   and air/water quality

   3. Infrastructure security — condition of roads, bridges, and
   buildings, transportation safety

   4. Personal safety — crime and violence, perceptions of personal
   security

   Tokyo, the [133]world’s most populous metropolitan area, took the prize
   for safest overall city, and also won for best digital security. Zurich
   was tops in both health and infrastructure, and Singapore in personal
   security.

   Across all the EIU’s indexes, which include “liveability,” “cost of
   living,” “food security” and more, the undisputed heavyweight champion
   of the world is…

   Toronto.

   Here’s the grain of salt. You’ll probably notice that some cities
   dubbed the most liveable are missing from the list of safe cities.
   Where’s Vancouver? Vienna? The report doesn’t make fully clear why many
   cities that [134]top EIU’s Global Liveability Index fail to show up on
   the Safety Index.

   Here are the top 10 safest cities, according to EIU. All photos from
   nighttime because it’s super safe!

   1. Tokyo

   2. Singapore

   3. Osaka

   4. Stockholm

   5. Amsterdam

   6. Sydney

   7. Zurich

   8. Toronto

   9. Melbourne

   10. New York City
     __________________________________________________________________

   The remaining cities, in order, are: Hong Kong, San Francisco, Taipei,
   Montreal, Barcelona, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Washington DC,
   Frankfurt, Madrid, Brussels, Paris, Seoul, Abu Dhabi, Milan, Rome,
   Santiago, Doha, Shanghai, Buenos Aires, Shenzhen, Lima, Tianjin, Rio de
   Janeiro, Kuwait City, Beijing, Guangzhou, Bangkok, Sao Paulo, Istanbul,
   Delhi, Moscow, Mumbai, Mexico City, Riyadh, Johannesburg, Ho Chi Minh
   City, Tehran, Jakarta.

       Hannah and Adam, "Pilot"
       One of our first exposures to uncomfortable “Girls” sex comes
       early, in the pilot episode, when Hannah and Adam “get feisty” (a
       phrase Hannah hates) on the couch. The pair is about to go at it
       doggy-style when Adam nearly inserts his penis in “the wrong hole,”
       and after Hannah corrects him, she awkwardly explains her lack of
       desire to have anal sex in too many words. “Hey, let’s play the
       quiet game,” Adam says, thrusting. And so the romance begins.

       sex, which is almost unbearable to watch. Elijah, who is trying to
       explore the “hetero side” of his bisexuality, can’t maintain his
       erection, and the entire affair ends in very uncomfortable silence.

       uncomfortable sex over the course of their relationship, one of the
       saddest moments (aside from Marnie breaking up with him during
       intercourse) is when Marnie encourages him to penetrate her from
       behind so she doesn’t have to look at him. “This feels so good,”
       Charlie says. “We have to go slow.” Poor sucker.

       that he “loves to eat pussy” moments before she admits she’s never
       “done it” before. At least it paves the way for the uncomfortable
       sex we later get to watch her have with Ray?

       Hannah and Adam, "Hard Being Easy"
       On the heels of trying (unsuccessfully) to determine the status of
       her early relationship with Adam, Hannah walks by her future
       boyfriend’s bedroom to find him masturbating alone, in one of the
       strangest scenes of the first season. As Adam jerks off and refuses
       to let Hannah participate beyond telling him how much she likes
       watching, we see some serious (and odd) character development ...
       which ends with Hannah taking a hundred-dollar bill from Adam’s
       wallet, for cab fare and pizza (as well as her services).

       After he turns Marnie on enough to make her masturbate in the
       bathroom at the gallery where she works, Booth finally seals the
       deal in a mortifying and nearly painful to watch sex scene that
       tells us pretty much everything we need to know about how much
       Marnie is willing to fake it.

       Tad and Loreen, "The Return"
       The only sex scene in the series not to feature one of the main
       characters, Hannah’s parents’ showertime anniversary celebration is
       easily one of the most cringe-worthy moments of the show’s first
       season. Even Hannah’s mother, Loreen, observes how embarrassing the
       situation is, which ends with her husband, Tad, slipping out of the
       shower and falling naked and unconscious on the bathroom floor.

       herself in bed with a former high school classmate, who doesn’t
       exactly enjoy it when Hannah puts one of her fingers near his anus.
       “I’m tight like a baby, right?” Hannah asks at one point. Time to
       press pause.

       While it’s not quite a full-on, all-out sex scene, Hannah and
       Adam’s attempt at role play in Season 3 is certainly an intimate
       encounter to behold (or not). Hannah dons a blond wig and gets a
       little too into her role, giving a melodramatic performance that
       ends with a passerby punching Adam in the face. So there’s that.

       evident than when Ray is penetrating a clothed and visibly

       if her partner will just “get out of me.”

13 of "Girls'" most cringeworthy sex scenes
       Marnie and Desi, "Iowa"
       Who gets her butt motorboated? Is this a real thing? Aside from the
       questionable logistics and reality of Marnie and Desi’s analingus
       scene, there’s also the awkward moment when Marnie confuses her
       partner’s declaration of love for licking her butthole with love
       for her. Oh, Marnie.

13 of "Girls'" most cringeworthy sex scenes
       Hannah and Adam, "Vagina Panic"
       There is too much in this scene to dissect: fantasies of an
       11-year-old girl with a Cabbage Patch lunchbox, excessive

       condom to ejaculate on Hannah’s chest. No wonder it ends with
       Hannah saying she almost came.
