Carrie Writes: Healthy lifestyle choices help prevent heart disease

   CHILI-2 0211
   A healthy diet, rich in vegetables and fiber, can help fight heart
   disease. (ASSOCIATED PRESS / FILE PHOTO)
   [110]Print
   [111]Carrie Barrepski By [112]Carrie Barrepski The Republican
   on February 04, 2015 at 9:27 AM, updated February 04, 2015 at 9:28 AM

   February is considered heart and stroke awareness month by the American
   Heart Association.

   According to the association, heart disease is the number one killer of
   women. Prevention can be as simple as keeping regular doctor’s
   appointments and making healthy life choices.

   The association recommends following a low-fat and high-fiber diet. It
   also recommends at least 150 minutes of physical exercise per week.

   Another tip is to learn how to manage stress and take care of yourself.

   I have always taken a healthy approach to life, especially since I have
   had congenital heart disease since birth. In the recent years I have
   become more self-aware due to having a successful heart valve
   replacement surgery.

   The key to good health is to be mindful, which is the practice of being
   aware of our mind, body and surroundings. This involves feeling the
   effects of our actions from eating to exercise.

   I have always practiced mindfulness to stay connected to myself since
   it helps guide me through everyday life. To keep myself mindful I
   meditate every morning to keep me focused and connected.

   Every day I practice vinyasa yoga, connecting breath with movement. It
   is a great way to work out that leaves me feeling healthy and
   energized.

   I also include a Pilates and ballet session to help tone my body. I
   always enjoy my daily workouts; it is my favorite time and activity of
   the day.

   Another important component to being healthy is eating in moderation.
   Practicing mindfulness can help determine what foods to eat, when we’re
   hungry and how much to eat.

   I follow a low fat semi-vegetarian plan. My diet consists of
   vegetables, beans, whole grains and fruits.

   To me being healthy is a lifestyle choice. We should treat our bodies
   as temples, fueling them and taking care of them.
