   Foreign Investment in Nairobi
   Monday, 30th March 2015

   Nairobi's very own Beverly Hills.  As much as anybody, both local and

   12 times more when compared with other urban and rural areas.  The
   rental market in Nairobi has been so lucrative that even indecent
   dwelling units, such as slums and squatter settlements, are attracting
   rent as much as Ksh2,500 for 10 by 10 single rooms.  The recent
   increase in rental costs in Nairobi has made the city one of the most
   lucrative property markets worldwide.
