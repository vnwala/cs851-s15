   A new study has found that over 30% people are afraid of taking
   [50]pills daily to prevent heart diseases and rather opt for a shorter
   life.

   The study conducted by American [51]Heart Association analysed people
   with an average age of 50 and established that more than 8% of people
   were willing to trade almost two years of their life to avoid taking
   daily medication for cardiovascular disease, whereas 21% would trade
   between one week and a year of their lives.

   In addition to people who were ready to keep their lives at stake,
   there were around 21% of people who said they would pay $1,000 or more
   to avoid taking a pill each day for the rest of their lives.

   There were around 70% of participants who were not interested to trade
   any weeks of their lives to avoid taking a CVD pill daily, and 62%
   weren't willing to gamble any risk of immediate death.

   Robert Hutchins, MD, MPH, lead author said that the act of having pills
   on daily basis can have a large effect on an individual's quality of
   life, and even a small reductions in quality of life like those found
   in this study, can have very large effects on the cost-effectiveness of
   that drug for a population.

   The study is published in Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes journal
   of American Heart Association.
