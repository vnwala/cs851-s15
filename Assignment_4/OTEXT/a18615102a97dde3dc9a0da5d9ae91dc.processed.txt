   BALINESE police have told a Gold Coast mum her son is dead after a body
   matching his description washed ashore, but Luciana Viera is refusing
   to give up hope.

   Fernando Campello, 24, has been missing for six days and Balinese
   police said a body washed up on Lombok Island two days ago is likely
   his.

   “They found a body yesterday and they got us to identify it but it was
   not him,” she said.

   “He is still alive.

   “The body had been in the water for weeks and he has only been missing
   for days. There were no tattoos on the body so I know it was not him.

   “They want a DNA test but I do not trust them.”

   Ms Viera said she had begged the Australian foreign embassy to attend
   the DNA test with her but was rejected because Mr Campello was
   travelling on a Brazilian passport.

   “I am really scared because I do not trust the police here,” she said.

   “I want an Australian doctor or a Brazilian doctor to come with me
   while I do it.”

   The Brazilian national went missing from his hotel room in Gili
   Trawangan, one of a group of three islands east of Bali.

   Balinese police were still searching after Ms Viera failed to identify
   the corpse.

   “I was speaking to the mum yesterday and she was crying,” said an
   officer who would only be named as Natamoken.

   “I am looking and the policemen are still looking on this island and
   all over Gili Islands.

   “I am telling people to bring the body to Gili if they find it because
   the mum is here.”

   Mr Campello had said he was worried about flying before heading
   overseas last year.

   Mr Campello and his friend Andre Romano, 24, left Australia in December
   on an Air Asia flight just one day after AirAsia flight 8501 plummeted
   into the ocean killing all 162 people on board.

   “No one knows what’s going on and that is the most worrying thing,”
   said Mr Campello at Gold Coast Airport moments before he was shuttled
   to his AirAsia flight to begin what was supposed to be the trip of a
   lifetime.

   Mr Romano said at the time that they would not let fear halt their
   trip. They were travelling to Kuala Lumpur.

   “We were very afraid when we first heard,” Mr Romano said. “We were
   trying not to think about it because we will be catching heaps more
   planes in our lives. We wouldn’t let it ruin our trip.”

   Mr Campello survived the flight, but two months later his family and
   numerous Australian authorities are desperately searching for any sign
   of the missing Brazilian.

   Ms Viera said her son went missing after consuming an alcoholic drink
   and falling sick.

   She said he was last seen walking back to his hotel on Gili Trawangan.

   A friend who walked back to the hotel room with Mr Campello said the
   young man had become paranoid and started to hear voices.

   The next morning his hotel room was empty.

   More concerning, Ms Viera said local authorities had refused to search
   nearby caves fearing “evil spirits”.

   It is the second tragedy to rock the Gold Coast’s Brazilian community
   with the alleged tomahawk murder of pregnant Fabiana Palhares on
   Monday.
