Battle looms over tough open Internet rules

   The fight for the soul of the Internet took a major turn Wednesday, as
   Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler's aggressive
   plan to keep the Internet open and neutral encountered enthusiastic
   support and threats of legal challenges.

   After Wheeler outlined his plan to apply decades-old rules to label
   Internet service providers as public utilities, broadband Internet
   providers and their supporters quickly labeled it as unnecessary
   regulation that would stifle innovation. They vowed to thwart the plan
   via lawsuits and other tactics.

   His backers — a diverse group ranging from Netflix and Google to an
   array of consumer groups — expressed their staunch approval in e-mails,
   comments and posts on Facebook and Twitter, reflecting the passion that
   net neutrality stirs among many.

   The FCC is scheduled to vote on the proposal, which would prohibit
   content providers from paying for faster service, on Feb. 26. The plan
   will be circulated to the other FCC commissioners on Thursday.

   It was an inauspicious day for the broadband industry, but not a
   surprising one. That Wheeler wants to apply the Title II authority for
   new net neutrality rules — named after the Title II of the
   Communications Act of 1934 — has been widely anticipated by industry
   watchers in recent weeks.

   President Obama said late last year that he favored the Title II
   option. Wheeler also indicated that he was leaning toward the approach
   at the CES trade show in Las Vegas last month. The FCC's previous net
   neutrality rules were tossed out by a federal court last year.

   Wheeler's proposal would mostly ban content providers from paying cable
   Internet companies, phone companies and wireless carriers to buy faster
   Internet "lanes" for their material, a practice known as "paid
   prioritization." ISPs also specifically will be prohibited from
   blocking or deliberately slowing access to legal content.

   Questions and answers about Obama's open Internet plan

   "Using (the Title II) authority, I am submitting to my colleagues the
   strongest open internet protections ever proposed by the FCC," Wheeler
   wrote in a story posted Wednesday on Wired.com. "These enforceable,
   bright-line rules will ban paid prioritization, and the blocking and
   throttling of lawful content and services. I propose to fully apply —
   for the first time ever — those bright-line rules to mobile broadband."

   "My proposal assures the rights of internet users to go where they
   want, when they want, and the rights of innovators to introduce new
   products without asking anyone's permission," he wrote.

   Wheeler's proposal will refrain from adopting some Title II provisions
   that don't apply to ISPs. To encourage Internet providers to invest,
   Wheeler also said he'll "modernize" Title II and "tailor it for the
   21st century."

   Michael Powell: Stop the Internet Iron Curtain

   The FCC will not regulate pricing and will impose no tariffs or rules
   that would require unbundling of services for consumers, he said. ISPs
   also will be allowed to conduct engineering work related to "reasonable
   network management."

   Some data services that don't go over the public Internet — such as
   voice-over-Internet phones and heart-monitoring services — will not be
   subject to the rules.

   "Today: a big day for the high speed Internet access story in America,"
   tweeted Susan Crawford, a noted net neutrality proponent and author of
   Captive Audience: The Telecom Industry and Monopoly Power in the New
   Gilded Age.

   Wheeler's proposal is hardly the last chapter of the net neutrality
   debate. Several lawmakers in Congress have introduced legislation that
   would regulate the Internet without treating ISPs as public utilities.

   Anticipating the announcement, Hank Hultquist, AT&T vice president for
   federal regulatory, indicated in a blog Monday that legal challenges
   are sure to follow. "Those who oppose efforts at compromise because
   they assume Title II rests on bulletproof legal theories are only
   deceiving themselves," he wrote.

   Verizon's deputy general counsel Michael Glover called Wheeler's
   proposal "unnecessary and counterproductive."

   The draft legislation, mostly supported by Republicans, should be
   sufficient, Glover argued. Wheeler's approach "is unnecessary because
   all participants in the Internet ecosystem support an open Internet,"
   he said. "It is counterproductive because heavy regulation of the
   Internet will create uncertainty and chill investment among the many
   players."

   ISPs have long dreaded the application of Title II, which has more than
   100 pages of text outlining do's and don'ts and would give the FCC
   immense regulatory power.

   Title II allows the FCC to obligate ISPs to open their back-end
   networks to content providers and third-party content-delivery
   companies, they say. It could also require ISPs to sell portions of
   their networks to resellers and require them to file reams of documents
   on their service, they said.

   But proponents say stringent rules are needed, because the cable
   industry is poised for consolidation and many consumers contend with
   local monopolies in broadband Internet service. Without specific rules,
   ISPs would be tempted to ban, slow down or seek payment from content
   providers that compete with a company that has an affiliation or is
   owned by the Internet provider, they argue. For example, Comcast, which
   is trying to buy Time Warner Cable, also owns NBC Universal, which has
   plans to expand streaming shows.

   Net neutrality rules could lead to legal quagmire

   Since he took on the task of recasting net neutrality rules, Wheeler
   and the FCC have been besieged with passionate comments from both sides
   of the debate. The agency has received about 4 million comments, a
   record.

   Wheeler said he also considered using another legal test — a
   determination of "commercial reasonableness" under Section 706 of the
   Telecommunications Act of 1996 — that would adjudicate any net
   neutrality violations on a case-by-case basis. He said he'll use some
   provisions of Section 706, along with Title II.

   Q&A: Net neutrality — what is at stake?

   "While a recent court decision seemed to draw a road map for using this
   approach, I became concerned that this relatively new concept might,
   down the road, be interpreted to mean what is reasonable for commercial
   interests, not consumers," Wheeler wrote Wednesday.

   Officials at the FCC were mulling over legal implications of several
   options when Obama made his announcement, which may have nudged Wheeler
   to move in the direction of Title II.

   "Congress wisely gave the FCC the power to update its rules to keep
   pace with innovation," Wheeler wrote. "Under that authority my proposal
   includes a general conduct rule that can be used to stop new and novel
   threats to the internet. This means the action we take will be strong
   enough and flexible enough not only to deal with the realities of
   today, but also to establish ground rules for the as yet unimagined."
