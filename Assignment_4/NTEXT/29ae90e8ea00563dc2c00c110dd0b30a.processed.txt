   AUSTIN, TEXAS, FEBRUARY 4, 2015 - Bearhawk Aircraft announced today two
   firsts for its Bearhawk Patrol aircraft kits: 1) The first flight of a
   completed Bearhawk Patrol in South Africa, and 2) The first shipment of
   a Bearhawk Patrol kit to Brazil. The Bearhawk Patrol, available as a
   Quick-Build kit, is a two-place tandem seated aircraft resembling the
   Piper Super Cub. It differs notably by its single-strut-braced wings
   and an advanced airfoil. These developments come shortly after the
   company publicly debuted its new Bearhawk LSA, a slightly smaller
   design that meets Sport Pilot requirements.

   The first Bearhawk Patrol, ZU-HUB, to fly in South Africa has now
   logged 27+ hours. Owned by South African Bearhawk distributor, Wayne
   Giles, ZU-HUB is turning heads in the region. Giles is reporting a fast
   cruise of 155 mph indicated at 75-percent power. The Patrol has a
   Superior IO-360 engine that develops 180 hp while swinging a
   three-bladed composite propeller from MT-Propeller.

   Mark Goldberg, president of Bearhawk Aircraft, commented, "What is
   surprising the aviation community of South Africa is the Patrol's fast
   cruise speed while still being able to land and takeoff as short as a
   PA-18 Super Cub." The Patrol's speed is attributed to the Riblett
   30-413.5 airfoil design and flush riveted wings. Commending Giles on
   his completion of the aircraft, Mark added, "Beautiful job Wayne!"

   Giles' son (a film major) produced a video of the aircraft's first
   flight; it can be viewed at [42]http://youtu.be/Ftj8foKVR2M. Photos of
   the first Bearhawk Patrol in Africa included one of the finished
   aircraft and Giles' "esteemed helper Mattheus." Wayne added he is "very
   pleased with the outcome and end result of the aeroplane we built
   together!" The South African Patrol was completed in two years,
   following delivery of the kit.

   Meanwhile across the Atlantic, the first Bearhawk Patrol Quick-Build
   kit was shipped to a customer in Brazil. A rancher from Santa Catarina
   province in southern Brazil, Fernando Frahm took a demo flight at
   AirVenture Oshkosh 2014, whereupon he decided to purchase the Patrol.
   Frahm knew it was the airplane he needed to land at the short strip on
   his ranch. It would also allow him greater travel flexibility at better
   cruise speeds than similar STOL/utility aircraft he had been
   considering.

   The Brazilian customer requested that the majority of items to complete
   his Quick-Build kit be packed in the shipping container. This is a
   common occurrence with overseas deliveries. Sourcing parts is more
   easily done is the U.S., and Bearhawk Aircraft is able to simplify
   shipping, customs and other considerations on behalf of its customers.
   For example, in late 2014, the company held a shipment while waiting
   for PolyFiber fabric covering supplies and Grove wheels/brakes to
   arrive. Goldberg commented, "We are always willing to help them out."
   Bearhawk aircraft kits have been exported to many countries around the
   globe, including: Canada, Ecuador, Brazil, Germany, Norway, South
   Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.

   Bearhawk Aircraft manufactures high-quality Quick-Build aircraft kits
   for the Bearhawk 4-Place, and two-place tandem Bearhawk Patrol and
   Bearhawk LSA. Designed by engineer Bob Barrows, the Bearhawks have in
   common excellent performance and superb flying characteristics.
   Bearhawks are known for their short field capability, higher than
   expected cruise speeds, and very gentle slow speed manners. For utility
   and recreational use, Bearhawk aircraft are flown by customers around
   the world.
