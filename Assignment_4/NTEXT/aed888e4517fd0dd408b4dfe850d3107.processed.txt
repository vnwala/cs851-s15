   AT&T Debuts Unified Communications for Work Teams
   AT&T Debuts Unified Communications for Work Teams

   The telecom giant is working hard to make business collaboration
   easier. AT&T’s latest effort toward that goal is the launch of AT&T UC
   Federation, a [37]cloud-based service that allows suppliers, partners
   and customers to communicate in real-time across various networks.

   AT&T UC Federation is working to overcome a real challenge for
   enterprises that demand dependable collaboration. Disparate unified
   communication (UC) systems have made seamless collaboration difficult
   at best and at times problematic. AT&T is working to tackle these
   challenges by making it possible for internal and external teams to
   collaborate freely across supported UC platforms.

   "Companies that try to set up UC platforms on their own can face
   challenges when creating scalable, secure connectivity that meets
   [38]compliance and support requirements," said Vishy Gopalakrishnan,
   AVP Big Data and Advanced Solutions at AT&T Business Solutions. "UC
   Federation from AT&T provides tools to help overcome this challenge by
   removing the hassle and allowing business teams to connect easily and
   over a highly securely platform."

   Avoiding UC Hiccups

   Created in AT&T Labs, AT&T UC Federation supports a number of UC
   platforms, including [39]Microsoft Lync and [40]Cisco Jabber. The
   technology also promises to give organizations the flexibility and
   [41]security to connect to any supported UC platforms where partners,
   suppliers and vendors are doing business.

   AT&T UC Federation also lets enterprises control which organizations
   can communicate at the company, group or user level and even allows
   certain communication methods, like instant messaging, and blocks
   others, such as online presence. The idea is to let enterprises share
   as much or as little information as they choose.

   AT&T is also promising direct benefits to businesses that are merging
   or creating joint ventures with other businesses. That’s because the
   platform gives customers the flexibility to grow and coexist without
   being limited to a single UC platform. It also helps support
   collaboration without any hiccups when a company switches to a new
   communications platform.

   Just the Beginning

   Some enterprises are already testing the platform. Sonus, a company
   that offers secure real-time communications, has deployed and tested
   AT&T UC Federation. The company is in the midst of a full-service
   rollout.

   "With AT&T UC Federation, our sales team can connect with key contacts
   on the spot, in less time than an e-mail would take," said Michael
   Swade, senior vice president of Worldwide Sales and Marketing, Sonus.
   "It makes collaboration easy, and it truly functions as if each user is
   communicating on the same platform. We can IM and check presence all
   within a secure connection."

   This is just the beginning for the AT&T UC Federation. The company
   plans to extend the platform beyond IM and presence to include calendar
   integration as well as video and voice capabilities later in 2015. AT&T
   also hinted that more UC platforms may also be supported in the future.
   The company is offering a free 90-day trial for UC Federation for up to
   25 users.
