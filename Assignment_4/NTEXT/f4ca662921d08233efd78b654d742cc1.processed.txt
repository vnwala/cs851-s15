Apple Raises $6.5 Billion From Bond Sale Funding Share Buybacks

   (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is showing it can keep coming back to the
   bond market to fund share buybacks and preserve its overseas cash
   hoard.

   The iPhone maker sold $6.5 billion in debt Monday in a deal that was
   bigger than it initially intended with borrowing costs that are some of
   its lowest ever. The offering included 30-year debt with a 3.45 percent
   coupon, or 0.3 percentage point less than the record-low yield
   investors demanded on Friday to own similar corporate debt with
   comparable maturities.

   Apple has now raised the equivalent of $39 billion from the bond market
   in less than two years, bringing the company closer to fulfilling a
   pledge to boost the value of its stock amid pressure from billionaire
   activist investor Carl Icahn. Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told
   analysts last week that the Cupertino, California-based company has
   completed $103 billion of it $130 billion capital returns plan.

   “Apple has proven itself to be pretty thoughtful and shrewd when it
   comes to capital allocation over the last couple of years, and that
   hasn’t been lost on the bond market,” said Scott Kessler, a technology
   analyst at S&P Capital IQ in New York. “It makes sense for them to be
   active participants in the corporate bond market.”

   Apple has been turning to bonds instead of using cash that’s mostly
   held overseas, which would subject it to repatriation taxes. Apple
   ended December with about $178 billion in cash and marketable
   securities, according to a company statement on Jan. 27. Of that $157.8
   billion were held by foreign subsidiaries.

Investors Rewarded

   Investors have been rewarded well for owning Apple bonds, which have
   returned 13.7 percent since the end of 2013, outperforming the 10.3
   percent gain in debt of similarly rated companies, according to Bank of
   America Merrill Lynch index data. The extra yield investors demand to
   own the debt has dropped 3 basis points during the same period, even as
   it widened 16 basis points on average for borrowings of companies with
   similar ratings. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.

   Icahn in October renewed pressure on Apple to accelerate the stock
   buybacks, saying its shares are undervalued and should be at $203.
   That’d give Apple a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion.
   Apple’s shares closed at $118.63 in New York Monday.

‘Bullish Signal’

   Apple increased its capital return program to $100 billion in April
   2013, including share buybacks and dividends. The company raised it by
   $30 billion in April last year along with a boost to the dividend and
   split of its stock 7-for-1.

   The new borrowings come after Apple posted a 30 percent jump in fiscal
   first quarter revenue to $74.6 billion on Jan. 27, its largest sales
   increase in three years. Net income rose 38 percent to a record $18
   billion.

   “The borrowing is a bullish signal in the confidence of their
   business,” said Michael Walkley, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity Inc.
   in Minneapolis. “A debt offering is about the sustainability of
   providing strong long-term cash flows, and taking advantage of
   attractively priced financing.”

   Steve Dowling, a spokesman for Apple, didn’t respond to a telephone
   call and e-mail seeking comment on the offering.

   The company issued the securities in five parts, including $2 billion
   of 30-year bonds, Bloomberg data show. The average yield on the
   highest-rated company bonds with maturities of at least 15 years was
   3.76 percent on Jan. 31, according to Bank of America Merill Lynch
   Index data.

   “Apple is getting attractive terms,” Mike Buchanan, the Pasadena,
   California-based head of global credit at Western Asset, said in a
   telephone interview. “The demand for high quality will continue to
   encourage companies to tap the market.”
