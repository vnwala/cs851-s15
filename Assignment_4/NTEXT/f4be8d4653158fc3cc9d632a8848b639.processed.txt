Book Description

   Beaten once again and left for dead by the man she should have been
   able to trust with her life, Kate awakened from a coma to discover that
   not only has she lost the precious baby she carried, the beating also
   damaged her internally so that doctors didn't think she would ever
   conceive again. As if that weren't enough, Kate is also nearly blind
   due to the injury to her brain.
   Scarred--not only physically, but emotionally and spiritually too--Kate
   moves in with her childhood friend to try to recover. Eventually her
   physical body begins to heal, but her emotional state seems to
   deteriorate with each passing day. It isn't until Patricia Daniels, an
   Irish psychotherapist, comes into her life that Kate finally starts
   putting the pieces back together in her shattered life.
   Patricia (Trish to her friends) takes Kate with her on holiday to
   Ireland and Scotland. Through a series of kindhearted Celtic men, brick
   by brick Kate is finally able to bring down the fortress she's built
   around herself. The only question is whether a shattered shell of a
   woman can love wholeheartedly.
   Heart Shaped Shards is not only an endearing romance, it is a story of
   triumph; a testimony to the perseverance of the human spirit. This
   novel deals with the difficult subject of spousal abuse, but leaves the
   reader with the knowledge that there is always hope...and when there's
   hope, amazing things can happen.
   "I had a love/hate relationship with this book. I absolutely LOVED the
   story, but the details of Kate's abuse opened up the closet to my own
   past. I am actually now in therapy because of it! I have Ms. MacAlister
   to thank for shoving me down the road to recovery :) "
   With her powerful new novel, Ria MacAlister is turning the tables with
   a hard-hitting depiction of the "woman next door."
   "Heart Shaped Shards" replaces swept-back billionaires and doting
   brides with the possibility that two souls who have been beaten down by
   the world may one day find each other.

Editorial Reviews

From the Author

   Hello Dear Reader,

   I wanted to share a little bit about what 'Heart Shaped Shards' meant
   to me when I was writing the story. I hope you won't mind a bit of
   self-indulgence.

   In 2010, I was hurting. I was in my fifth marriage, but felt very much
   alone. My husband was actually a great guy and not the abusers I had
   been unfortunate to be married to in the past, but he was emotionally
   absent. I don't blame him. I probably added fuel to the fire with my
   tendency to retreat into a protective shell.

   Oh, on the outside I was fine. Held it together pretty well, even to
   those closest to me. But on the inside, the place where those closet
   skeletons like to sneak out and torment you, I was a wreck. There was
   no way I was going to seek counseling...that was for crazy people,
   right? Well, I didn't want to admit to that, although I'm sure I would
   have greatly benefited from a few hundred go-rounds with a
   psychologist.

   Instead, I did a bit of soul-searching and decided what I needed
   most--the one thing I had never had--was a caring, loving, protective
   man. Certain such a creature didn't truly exist, I tried to find him in
   books.

   What I found instead were a lot of great stories that were so far from
   true life that it really sunk me further into a funk. Oh, there were a
   few heroes who came very close to what I needed (Arion of 'Shadow
   Fires' from Catherine Spangler's amazing Shielder Series quickly comes
   to mind), but none who were very believable for an everyday, real-life
   man (Arion lived on another planet in a galaxy far, far away, for
   Pete's sake!). So, I decided to write "my man."

   I won't spoil the story by giving you too many details, but I do want
   to say that, after writing the book and going through the inevitable
   divorce, I actually MET "my man"!! I am now married to the alpha male
   hero of my dreams, and we couldn't be happier!

   So, as I like to say, happy endings do happen...you just have to wait
   for them.

   Much love,

   Ria

About the Author

   Ria MacAlister has not lived a fairy-tale life. Molested as a child,
   raped as a teen and abused as a wife, she buried herself in books and
   relationships to help numb self-deprecating feelings. When her fifth
   marriage started heading south, she began writing as a panacea of sorts
   to help heal her own scars, completing her first novel in just seven
   months.
   Ria lives in the southwestern United States with her sixth (and she
   swears last!) husband, who happens to closely resemble the hero of
   'Heart Shaped Shards'. Ria says she met her husband after she wrote the
   novel, knowing right away this marriage was meant to be. They're
   currently pursuing their happily ever after.

   I loved this book! The story line was a little dark at first, but it
   was a great read on the whole. I do have to say that while I loved the
   entire story, I really found it unbelievable that so many masculine men
   would cry as they do. That's all I found a little off with this novel.
   The rest was just fantastic. Great work.

   5.0 out of 5 stars [81]Heartshaped Shards January 25, 2013
   By [82]Pure Jonel
   Format:Kindle Edition
   One of the best things about novels like this is that they take a very
   sensitive subject and bring it to the forefront allowing for discussion
   on the topic. Even though a great deal of individuals would like to
   ignore or even deny its existence, spousal abuse does exist. MacAlister
   takes the subject and creates an amazingly realistic and very gripping
   story from it.
   I loved the fact that this was not your stereotypical romance novel.
   Yes, it had the elements. Girl falls for boy. Boy falls for girl. They
   live life happily ever after. But this novel was so much more. The
   characters had real issues to overcome and they were not 20 year olds
   from the highest strata of society.
   MacAlister's writing is clear, concise and to the point while still
   full of detail that breathes life into the story. Her writing is not
   overly flowery, powder puff writing. She creates such realistic scenes
   that you feel like you are there, feeling pain and/or joy with the
   characters. She is also able to make that unmistakable feeling of the
   unreality of a situation come to life on the pages.
   The characters in this novel are also phenomenal. MacAlister has nailed
   the actual aggressor, victim, and alpha male (swoon) behaviours and
   responses, rather than relying on cultural stereotypes. I am very
   impressed that she took the extra time for this. In my opinion, this
   increases not only the reliability of the novel, but also the enjoyment
   level for the reader.
   As much as the plight of the protagonist is heart wrenching, I
   definitely laughed my butt off more than once while reading this novel.
   MacAlister manages to evoke the entire emotional spectra in her readers
   throughout the novel. By the end of the novel I was simultaneously in
   love (with Shay), in lust (with Patrick), and in hate (with Tony). It
   was absolutely brilliant.

   By [87]Joan65
   Format:Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
   I saw a link for this book on a social network site and decided to
   download it. I found myself laughing & crying many times throughout the
   book. Ms. MacAlisiter most certainly has a knack for drawing the reader
   in & keeping their interest.
   I was so captivated by the whole story!!! Her character development is
   simply amazing. I felt like I knew everyone in the book & could picture
   how they looked and what their voices would actually sound like. I love
   romance stories and this one blew me away.
   It wasn't your typical sappy "all's right with the world & they lived
   happily ever after" story. There were amazing "never saw that coming"
   moments that really kept me interested. I can't wait for the next
   story!!!!
   Way to go RIA!!!!

   5.0 out of 5 stars [96]Fantastic Book. October 16, 2012
   By [97]Kelly R
   Format:Kindle Edition
   I want to start by saying Ria MacAlister did a great job in writing
   this book. I loved it from the beginning to the end. It was an
   extremely well written book. I felt all of Katie's pain and fears like
   they were my own. I got lost in this book. Ria made the charcters seem
   like they were real. This wonderful book had me on an emoitional
   rollercoaster, but in a good way. I would recommend this book. I really
   can't wait for the next book.

   4.0 out of 5 stars [106]A Great Debut September 24, 2013
   By [107]T B M
   Format:Kindle Edition
   Heartshaped Shards is a tough read in the beginning. Kate Kincaid is in
   a horrible relationship and her husband is a monster in my opinion. One
   night he beats her and leaves her for dead. She doesn't die, but she's
   emotionally and physically scarred.
   Luckily for Kate she has two incredible friends to help her through it.
   During a trip to Ireland and Scotland she discovers something about
   herself. I won't say too much more since I don't want to ruin the
   story.
   This story is an emotional roller coaster. At times I was laughing and
   then I would plunge into sadness. Kate is the type of character that
   readers cheer for. She's vulnerable, but determined, witty, but also
   clueless, and quite lovable. It you enjoy stories about the power of
   love don't miss this one.
   I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

   By [112]Alice Recker
   Format:Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
   Without a doubt Ria MacAlister brings to the forefront the horrific
   abuse that goes on between spouses and partners. The story was riveting
   and the reader is more than satisfied with the ending when the victim
   becomes the victor. I couldn't put the book down until I knew things
   were going to be all right again.

   relationships to help numb self-deprecating feelings. When her fifth
   marriage started heading south, she began writing as a panacea of sorts

   One friend encouraged, "It has to be shared! I think it could really
   help someone else. If just one person is helped, then it's worth it,
   isn't it?" So, Ria took a leap of faith and put her story into the
   public's hands.
   Ria lives in the southwestern United States with her sixth (and she
   swears last!) husband, who happens to closely resemble the hero of
   'Heartshaped Shards'. Ria says she met her husband after she wrote the
   novel, knowing right away this marriage was meant to be. "There really
   are happy endings out there...you just have to wait for them."
