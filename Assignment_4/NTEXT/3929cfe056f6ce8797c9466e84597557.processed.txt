Berlin Muslim preacher Says Women Should not Refuse Having Sex with Their

   Berlin Muslim preacher Says Women Should not Refuse Having Sex with
   Their Husbands

   Rabat – A Berlin Muslim preacher has reportedly proclaimed that women
   “should be confined to their husband’s home” and never refuse to sleep
   with their husbands.

   In a YouTube video whose content has been reported by the Deutshe Welle
   and other German local media, Sheikh Abdel Moez al-Eila, a Berlin-based
   Imam known for his extemist preaching, called for the submission of
   women to their husbands and that a woman is not allowed to refuse
   sleeping with her husband under any excuses or pretexts.

   The sermon was originally held on January 23 at al-Nur mosque in the
   NeuKolln district of the German capital, according to the Deutshe Welle
   (DW).

   Sheikh Abdel Moez al-Eila said that a woman has the responsibility of
   “turning the home into a flourishing garden for her husband, so that he
   does not flee from her like one flees a leper of a lion.”

   He also said that a woman “should confine to her husband’s home and
   neihter leave the house, let anyone into the house, nor sleep outside
   the house without her husband’s permission.”

   The Imam added that when a man is ‘aroused’ by another woman, “he
   should go home quickly and have sex with his wife and Allah will
   immediately remove the urge from his heart.”

   “There is nothing to prevent her husband from using her body for
   pleasure,” Sheikh Abdel Moez al-Eila said, adding that even when a
   woman is mensturating she is not allowed to make excuses.

   Abdel Moez al-Eila will reportedly hold sermons in the al-Nur mosque in
   Berlin until the end of the month.
