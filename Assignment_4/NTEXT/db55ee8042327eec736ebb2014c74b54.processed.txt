   [20]2015... What will YOU do? (with your data)

      [23]image It’s the beginning of a new calendar year -- time for new
      expectations, contemplation and intentional examination of the past
      with the objective of developing strategic changes or improvements for
      the future.  I look forward to the constant change that comes with
      progress and hope that the New Year brings you effective data
      resolutions.   Wishing you all a 2015 filled with data success –
      assurance of data dilemmas becoming data delivered!

      In a  recent IBM white paper entitled [24]‘Meeting demands for high
      availability with advanced data protection’, research confirms, “In a
      recent survey of IT experts in both midsized and large organizations,
      49 percent said that they can’t tolerate more than 15 minutes of
      downtime for high-priority applications, while 25 percent had no
      tolerance for downtime within these critical applications. High
      availability and advanced data protection capabilities once reserved
      for financial institutions and large enterprises are now being widely
      adopted across industries and in organizations of all sizes.”

      It’s no wonder that data management and protection continues to grow in
      importance for all businesses and organizations regardless of size or
      the scale of data generated.  As the new year begins, it affords the
      opportunity to examine whether the right data decisions are in place
      and whether those decisions position you to welcome the new year with
      confidence.  To help with this data dilemma and ensure high
      availability and data protection, here are five data tips all IT people
      should ponder:

      Tip #1: Consider embracing hybrid cloud with more alacrity

      At the cost of repeating myself, enterprises who are not quick to adopt
      hybrid cloud run the risk of being left behind by competition or
      becoming obsolete.  Hybrid cloud is an extremely agile and convenient
      means to gain business agility.  Creating a private cloud can help you
      consolidate various business unit workloads as well as enable cost
      savings by allowing the private cloud to be sized to the average
      workload; thus, hybrid cloud makes it the right business and data mix.
       Plan your data distribution well and hybrid cloud may be the perfect
      solution for your data protection for the future.

      I invite you to join the upcoming January 21 news cast “[25]Eliminate
      the Barriers to Your Cloud Adoption”.  Where I sit and have a candid
      discussion with a tier-one storage analyst from IDC, a leading Business
      Partner – CAS Severn, and current client (Loyola) to go deeper into the
      hybrid cloud topic.

      [26]image
      Tip #2: Ensure your data protection solution is an analytics-based
      solution

      As per Gartner, “Analytics will take center stage as the volume of data
      generated by embedded systems increases and vast pools of structured
      and unstructured data inside and outside the enterprise are analyzed.
      Organizations need to manage how best to filter the huge amounts of
      data coming from various sources and then deliver exactly the right
      information to the right person, at the right time. Analytics will
      become deeply, but invisibly embedded everywhere.”

      Storage analytics are increasingly essential to plan and optimize
      today’s complex storage operational environments.  Growing
      organizations must quickly identify bottlenecks and find innovative
      ways to maximize and optimize capacity.  Storage analytics helps you:
       1. Resolve typical cost issues and complexity of deploying storage
          management infrastructure
       2. The inability to predict future data/storage capacity needs
       3. Improve visibility into performance bottlenecks

      Hence, it is important to ensure your data protection solution has
      in-built storage analytics to avoid wrestling with all these issues.
      Tip #3: Storage virtualization with built in management benefits all
      greatly

      Storage virtualization is a continuing and critical requirement.  As
      we’re all aware, its benefits are many time over: improved utilization,
      resiliency, flexibility, responsiveness, workload mobility and disaster
      recovery.  I encourage all my clients to adopt more storage
      virtualization.  I have discovered that the deployments of storage
      virtualization are following the same trends that compute
      virtualization did nearly a decade ago.  Once a client deploys
      virtualization, they immediately want to manage that new environment
      and start to look for technologies to do that.  So, instead of forcing
      clients to go through that double pain, clients should look for
      solutions that not only virtualize their storage environment, but
      manage it and protects the data as well….all in one solution!

      Tip #4: Policy based automation

      Improve your data management and availability through policy-based
      automation.  Automation increases efficiency significantly since it is
      (should be) based on analytics driven data.  Ensure that you replace
      your manual processes with policy-driven decisions and you’ll be on
      your way to establishing a more streamlined, efficient and stress-free
      data movement, management, and protection system for your organization.

      Tip #5: Consider abstracting embedded functionality out of hardware and
      into software-based solutions

      This is important too as it establishes a starting point for
      software-defined environments but doesn’t change much of the
      functionality.  Abstracting functionality into software-based solutions
      ensures more ease-of-use, flexible deployment models, vendor
      portability, and an easy on-ramp for hybrid cloud deployments.

      It is my recommendation that each business take a good look at where
      they stand against these five areas.  Then determine what to focus on
      and address first to get ahead or ignore and be left behind.  Data is
      the new natural resource and it’s continued growth is here to stay.
      Until next time...keep your data secure, agile, and available.
