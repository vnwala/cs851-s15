visitation of the ghost

   i'm THE WORINDLVE, but i also go by tomas, kazumi and red. i'm a cool
   ghost, here to haunt your cool house. you can give me nicknames if you
   want (tommy or kazu, for example).

   [1]buddy and [2]sam are my tender gay family and i love them

   my pronouns are it / its and they / them / their. you can use neutral
   or traditionally masculine language to refer to me, including language
   referring to me as a thing. if we're friends you may use he / him / his
   to refer to me.

   i'm mixed-race (filipino, japanese, white) and gray-aromantic asexual
   and also super gay. i am 16. i am an artist. i am also an abuse
   survivor, so i will talk about abuse sometimes. expect talk of social
   issues.

   as for fandom-related stuff, i will talk about video games and not much
   else. it's generally "whatever i'm playing right now" that comes up,
   which changes from month to month, although right now it's thief.

   i am autistic and have anxiety, hypochondria, depression and ADHD.
   these will come up often as well as they're a big part of my life.
