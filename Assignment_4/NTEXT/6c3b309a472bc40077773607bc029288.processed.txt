   This is a weekly MEME hosted by [20]Taking on a World of Words. Simply
   answer the following questions. :)

   The three Ws are:
   What are you currently reading?
   What did you recently finish reading?
   What do you think you‚Äôll read next?

   I am currently reading:

   [21]249747 [22]22066090

   Artemis Fowl I am reading on my own and Time‚Äôs Edge I am listening to
   the audiobook at work. I always have a book I read on my own and then a
   book that I listen to while working.

   I recently finished reading:

   [23]18108877

   Since it is a new month, I am just going to use what I finished this
   month. I just finished Timebound yesterday and I actually loved it more
   than I thought I would.

   The books I think I‚Äôll read next:

   [24]17331269 [25]20910157

   This month I decided to finally get around to reading the books I
   started and never finished. I started Lost in Babylon about
   SIX months ago and just stopped reading it, so I really want to finish
   that book. I also recently bought Yes Please and want to read that next
   because I have been dying to read it. I read a few pages of it, but
   decided to hold off on it until I finished the books I got from the
   library. I haven‚Äôt found the audiobook I‚Äôm gonna listen to next.

   What are you currently reading? Finished reading? Reading next?

       I haven‚Äôt read Artemis Fowl in ages but I LOVED it when I did read
       it. This is the second time I‚Äôve see Poehler‚Äôs book on a WWW today!
       I hope you enjoy it. Thanks for joining the community!
