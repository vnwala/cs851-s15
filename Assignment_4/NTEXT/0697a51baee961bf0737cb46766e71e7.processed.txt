WWE News: NXT Superstar Kalisto To Debut As A Gay Hair Stylist On Main
Roster?

   Kalisto NXT WWE Kalisto NXT WWE

   In WWE’s history, superstars have portrayed a wide variety of gimmicks.
   Some are well-received by the WWE Universe, while others are put on the
   metaphorical shelf of distaste. For example, Leo Kruger, in NXT, came
   to the WWE’s main roster as Adam Rose. At first, the crowd popped for
   him, because he was different. Over time, that faded away, and now Rose
   is a jobber for WWE.

   Rose is a guy who had a great gimmick in NXT, but the WWE Creative team
   changed it. Adrian Neville, who is [138]rumored to be coming up to the
   main roster, might get a gimmick change. Instead of having no gimmick
   while being over with the NXT crowd, WWE wants to have him portray a
   “Mighty Mouse” gimmick.

   So far, the WWE fans online don’t care for the idea. However, that time
   has not come yet, so there’s time to change their minds if need be.

   The next man to get [139]called up after Neville is Kalisto. He just
   dropped the NXT Tag-Team titles to Blake and Murphy last week. Upon his
   call-up to Raw and Smackdown, Kalisto is [140]rumored to get a new
   gimmick. According to Reddit user MetsFan4Ever, Kalisto might get a new
   gimmick that will garner a unique reaction from the WWE Universe.

   He reports that WWE is looking for a new masked star to take over with
   Rey Mysterio likely leaving but NXT officials recently tried Kalisto
   out with a new, unmasked gimmick – that of a gay hair stylist.

   Kalisto reportedly did very well in the role and is seriously being
   considered to do that gimmick instead of continuing with the Kalisto
   character.

   Now, if the WWE decides to keep this gimmick on Kalisto, then they will
   certainly be prepared for the different responses from the WWE
   Universe. The last time a WWE superstar portrayed a gay, or lesbian,
   character was during the early 2000s, when Chuck Palumbo and Billy Gunn
   teased a relationship. That was also in the TV-14 era of WWE
   programming.

   It is 2015, and the WWE has been [141]public about a good relationship
   with the “NOH8″ campaign that went viral last year. Many big names
   within WWE such as Stephanie McMahon, Triple H, Daniel Bryan, and
   Batista joined the LGBT community for equality.

   WWE is also known for supporting GLAAD on their Spirit Day by going
   all-out in purple for the cause. It’s been more prevalent since Darren
   Young, WWE superstar, [142]announced he was gay two years ago.

   The big question on everyone’s minds is how the WWE Universe will act
   upon Kalisto’s rumored gimmick. Everyone is entitled to his or her own
   opinion, and perhaps WWE will test it out at house shows first. We’ll
   keep you updated on this story as it develops.

       No
    2. Stacy Silvers [157]February 4th, 2015
       wtf no. It's offensive to gay hairstylists, luchadors and fans in
       general.
    3. [158]Ben Fuller [159]February 4th, 2015
       I think this would just be another big mistake from wwe. There
       current content is crap enough. This isn't about being gay or not
       but he has a good thing going as kalisto. If they change him he
       will likely end up like Adam rose a early to mid card jobber being
       outshone by a bunny. It be better to use Darren young in this
       gimmick. He is gay and would therefor be more beleiveable. People's
       sexuality doesn't concern me and is none of my buisness but I feel
       if they feel a need to do a gimmick like this bring in or use some
       e who is gay to play the gimmick. Kalistos career is at stake here.
       These early months in the main roster career make or break them as
       either the next beak it superstar or at once talented guy wrestler
       stuck with jobber status
    4. Pedro Gama [160]February 7th, 2015
       nope
