The 10 safest cities in the world

Only one American city cracks the Economist Intelligence Unit's list, and
it's probably not the one you'd expect

   [128]The 10 safest cities in the world (Credit: [129]Shutterstock/Sean
   Pavone)
   This article originally appeared on [130]GlobalPost.

   [131]Global Post Live in a city? Want to find out how safe you are? The
   Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) has got you covered.

   The EIU released its [132]Safe Cities Index 2015 this week, which rates
   50 cities based on how well they do in four safety-related factors:

   1. Digital security — cyber security, privacy, safety from identity
   theft

   2. Health security — cost and quality of health services, environment
   and air/water quality

   3. Infrastructure security — condition of roads, bridges, and
   buildings, transportation safety

   4. Personal safety — crime and violence, perceptions of personal
   security

   Tokyo, the [133]world’s most populous metropolitan area, took the prize
   for safest overall city, and also won for best digital security. Zurich
   was tops in both health and infrastructure, and Singapore in personal
   security.

   Across all the EIU’s indexes, which include “liveability,” “cost of
   living,” “food security” and more, the undisputed heavyweight champion
   of the world is…

   Toronto.

   Here’s the grain of salt. You’ll probably notice that some cities
   dubbed the most liveable are missing from the list of safe cities.
   Where’s Vancouver? Vienna? The report doesn’t make fully clear why many
   cities that [134]top EIU’s Global Liveability Index fail to show up on
   the Safety Index.

   Here are the top 10 safest cities, according to EIU. All photos from
   nighttime because it’s super safe!

   1. Tokyo

   2. Singapore

   3. Osaka

   4. Stockholm

   5. Amsterdam

   6. Sydney

   7. Zurich

   8. Toronto

   9. Melbourne

   10. New York City
     __________________________________________________________________

   The remaining cities, in order, are: Hong Kong, San Francisco, Taipei,
   Montreal, Barcelona, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Washington DC,
   Frankfurt, Madrid, Brussels, Paris, Seoul, Abu Dhabi, Milan, Rome,
   Santiago, Doha, Shanghai, Buenos Aires, Shenzhen, Lima, Tianjin, Rio de
   Janeiro, Kuwait City, Beijing, Guangzhou, Bangkok, Sao Paulo, Istanbul,
   Delhi, Moscow, Mumbai, Mexico City, Riyadh, Johannesburg, Ho Chi Minh
   City, Tehran, Jakarta.

       Hannah and Adam, "Pilot"
       One of our first exposures to uncomfortable “Girls” sex comes
       early, in the pilot episode, when Hannah and Adam “get feisty” (a
       phrase Hannah hates) on the couch. The pair is about to go at it
       doggy-style when Adam nearly inserts his penis in “the wrong hole,”
       and after Hannah corrects him, she awkwardly explains her lack of
       desire to have anal sex in too many words. “Hey, let’s play the
       quiet game,” Adam says, thrusting. And so the romance begins.

       sex, which is almost unbearable to watch. Elijah, who is trying to
       explore the “hetero side” of his bisexuality, can’t maintain his
       erection, and the entire affair ends in very uncomfortable silence.

       uncomfortable sex over the course of their relationship, one of the
       saddest moments (aside from Marnie breaking up with him during
       intercourse) is when Marnie encourages him to penetrate her from
       behind so she doesn’t have to look at him. “This feels so good,”
       Charlie says. “We have to go slow.” Poor sucker.

       that he “loves to eat pussy” moments before she admits she’s never
       “done it” before. At least it paves the way for the uncomfortable
       sex we later get to watch her have with Ray?

       Hannah and Adam, "Hard Being Easy"
       On the heels of trying (unsuccessfully) to determine the status of
       her early relationship with Adam, Hannah walks by her future
       boyfriend’s bedroom to find him masturbating alone, in one of the
       strangest scenes of the first season. As Adam jerks off and refuses
       to let Hannah participate beyond telling him how much she likes
       watching, we see some serious (and odd) character development ...
       which ends with Hannah taking a hundred-dollar bill from Adam’s
       wallet, for cab fare and pizza (as well as her services).

       After he turns Marnie on enough to make her masturbate in the
       bathroom at the gallery where she works, Booth finally seals the
       deal in a mortifying and nearly painful to watch sex scene that
       tells us pretty much everything we need to know about how much
       Marnie is willing to fake it.

       Tad and Loreen, "The Return"
       The only sex scene in the series not to feature one of the main
       characters, Hannah’s parents’ showertime anniversary celebration is
       easily one of the most cringe-worthy moments of the show’s first
       season. Even Hannah’s mother, Loreen, observes how embarrassing the
       situation is, which ends with her husband, Tad, slipping out of the
       shower and falling naked and unconscious on the bathroom floor.

       herself in bed with a former high school classmate, who doesn’t
       exactly enjoy it when Hannah puts one of her fingers near his anus.
       “I’m tight like a baby, right?” Hannah asks at one point. Time to
       press pause.

       While it’s not quite a full-on, all-out sex scene, Hannah and
       Adam’s attempt at role play in Season 3 is certainly an intimate
       encounter to behold (or not). Hannah dons a blond wig and gets a
       little too into her role, giving a melodramatic performance that
       ends with a passerby punching Adam in the face. So there’s that.

       evident than when Ray is penetrating a clothed and visibly

       if her partner will just “get out of me.”

       Marnie and Desi, "Iowa"
       Who gets her butt motorboated? Is this a real thing? Aside from the
       questionable logistics and reality of Marnie and Desi’s analingus

       partner’s declaration of love for licking her butthole with love
       for her. Oh, Marnie.

13 of "Girls'" most cringeworthy sex scenes
       Hannah and Adam, "Vagina Panic"
       There is too much in this scene to dissect: fantasies of an
       11-year-old girl with a Cabbage Patch lunchbox, excessive

       condom to ejaculate on Hannah’s chest. No wonder it ends with
       Hannah saying she almost came.

Book Description

   Beaten once again and left for dead by the man she should have been
   able to trust with her life, Kate awakened from a coma to discover that
   not only has she lost the precious baby she carried, the beating also
   damaged her internally so that doctors didn't think she would ever
   conceive again. As if that weren't enough, Kate is also nearly blind
   due to the injury to her brain.
   Scarred--not only physically, but emotionally and spiritually too--Kate
   moves in with her childhood friend to try to recover. Eventually her
   physical body begins to heal, but her emotional state seems to
   deteriorate with each passing day. It isn't until Patricia Daniels, an
   Irish psychotherapist, comes into her life that Kate finally starts
   putting the pieces back together in her shattered life.
   Patricia (Trish to her friends) takes Kate with her on holiday to
   Ireland and Scotland. Through a series of kindhearted Celtic men, brick
   by brick Kate is finally able to bring down the fortress she's built
   around herself. The only question is whether a shattered shell of a
   woman can love wholeheartedly.
   Heart Shaped Shards is not only an endearing romance, it is a story of
   triumph; a testimony to the perseverance of the human spirit. This
   novel deals with the difficult subject of spousal abuse, but leaves the
   reader with the knowledge that there is always hope...and when there's
   hope, amazing things can happen.
   "I had a love/hate relationship with this book. I absolutely LOVED the
   story, but the details of Kate's abuse opened up the closet to my own
   past. I am actually now in therapy because of it! I have Ms. MacAlister
   to thank for shoving me down the road to recovery :) "
   With her powerful new novel, Ria MacAlister is turning the tables with
   a hard-hitting depiction of the "woman next door."
   "Heart Shaped Shards" replaces swept-back billionaires and doting
   brides with the possibility that two souls who have been beaten down by
   the world may one day find each other.

Editorial Reviews

From the Author

   Hello Dear Reader,

   I wanted to share a little bit about what 'Heart Shaped Shards' meant
   to me when I was writing the story. I hope you won't mind a bit of
   self-indulgence.

   In 2010, I was hurting. I was in my fifth marriage, but felt very much
   alone. My husband was actually a great guy and not the abusers I had
   been unfortunate to be married to in the past, but he was emotionally
   absent. I don't blame him. I probably added fuel to the fire with my
   tendency to retreat into a protective shell.

   Oh, on the outside I was fine. Held it together pretty well, even to
   those closest to me. But on the inside, the place where those closet
   skeletons like to sneak out and torment you, I was a wreck. There was
   no way I was going to seek counseling...that was for crazy people,
   right? Well, I didn't want to admit to that, although I'm sure I would
   have greatly benefited from a few hundred go-rounds with a
   psychologist.

   Instead, I did a bit of soul-searching and decided what I needed
   most--the one thing I had never had--was a caring, loving, protective
   man. Certain such a creature didn't truly exist, I tried to find him in
   books.

   What I found instead were a lot of great stories that were so far from
   true life that it really sunk me further into a funk. Oh, there were a
   few heroes who came very close to what I needed (Arion of 'Shadow
   Fires' from Catherine Spangler's amazing Shielder Series quickly comes
   to mind), but none who were very believable for an everyday, real-life
   man (Arion lived on another planet in a galaxy far, far away, for
   Pete's sake!). So, I decided to write "my man."

   I won't spoil the story by giving you too many details, but I do want
   to say that, after writing the book and going through the inevitable
   divorce, I actually MET "my man"!! I am now married to the alpha male
   hero of my dreams, and we couldn't be happier!

   So, as I like to say, happy endings do happen...you just have to wait
   for them.

   Much love,

   Ria

About the Author

   Ria MacAlister has not lived a fairy-tale life. Molested as a child,
   raped as a teen and abused as a wife, she buried herself in books and
   relationships to help numb self-deprecating feelings. When her fifth
   marriage started heading south, she began writing as a panacea of sorts
   to help heal her own scars, completing her first novel in just seven
   months.
   Ria lives in the southwestern United States with her sixth (and she
   swears last!) husband, who happens to closely resemble the hero of
   'Heart Shaped Shards'. Ria says she met her husband after she wrote the
   novel, knowing right away this marriage was meant to be. They're
   currently pursuing their happily ever after.

   I loved this book! The story line was a little dark at first, but it
   was a great read on the whole. I do have to say that while I loved the
   entire story, I really found it unbelievable that so many masculine men
   would cry as they do. That's all I found a little off with this novel.
   The rest was just fantastic. Great work.

   5.0 out of 5 stars [80]Heartshaped Shards January 25, 2013
   By [81]Pure Jonel
   Format:Kindle Edition
   One of the best things about novels like this is that they take a very
   sensitive subject and bring it to the forefront allowing for discussion
   on the topic. Even though a great deal of individuals would like to
   ignore or even deny its existence, spousal abuse does exist. MacAlister
   takes the subject and creates an amazingly realistic and very gripping
   story from it.
   I loved the fact that this was not your stereotypical romance novel.
   Yes, it had the elements. Girl falls for boy. Boy falls for girl. They
   live life happily ever after. But this novel was so much more. The
   characters had real issues to overcome and they were not 20 year olds
   from the highest strata of society.
   MacAlister's writing is clear, concise and to the point while still
   full of detail that breathes life into the story. Her writing is not
   overly flowery, powder puff writing. She creates such realistic scenes
   that you feel like you are there, feeling pain and/or joy with the
   characters. She is also able to make that unmistakable feeling of the
   unreality of a situation come to life on the pages.
   The characters in this novel are also phenomenal. MacAlister has nailed
   the actual aggressor, victim, and alpha male (swoon) behaviours and
   responses, rather than relying on cultural stereotypes. I am very
   impressed that she took the extra time for this. In my opinion, this
   increases not only the reliability of the novel, but also the enjoyment
   level for the reader.
   As much as the plight of the protagonist is heart wrenching, I
   definitely laughed my butt off more than once while reading this novel.
   MacAlister manages to evoke the entire emotional spectra in her readers
   throughout the novel. By the end of the novel I was simultaneously in
   love (with Shay), in lust (with Patrick), and in hate (with Tony). It
   was absolutely brilliant.

   By [86]Joan65
   Format:Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
   I saw a link for this book on a social network site and decided to
   download it. I found myself laughing & crying many times throughout the
   book. Ms. MacAlisiter most certainly has a knack for drawing the reader
   in & keeping their interest.
   I was so captivated by the whole story!!! Her character development is
   simply amazing. I felt like I knew everyone in the book & could picture
   how they looked and what their voices would actually sound like. I love
   romance stories and this one blew me away.
   It wasn't your typical sappy "all's right with the world & they lived
   happily ever after" story. There were amazing "never saw that coming"
   moments that really kept me interested. I can't wait for the next
   story!!!!
   Way to go RIA!!!!

   5.0 out of 5 stars [95]Fantastic Book. October 16, 2012
   By [96]Kelly R
   Format:Kindle Edition
   I want to start by saying Ria MacAlister did a great job in writing
   this book. I loved it from the beginning to the end. It was an
   extremely well written book. I felt all of Katie's pain and fears like
   they were my own. I got lost in this book. Ria made the charcters seem
   like they were real. This wonderful book had me on an emoitional
   rollercoaster, but in a good way. I would recommend this book. I really
   can't wait for the next book.

   4.0 out of 5 stars [105]A Great Debut September 24, 2013
   By [106]T B M
   Format:Kindle Edition
   Heartshaped Shards is a tough read in the beginning. Kate Kincaid is in
   a horrible relationship and her husband is a monster in my opinion. One
   night he beats her and leaves her for dead. She doesn't die, but she's
   emotionally and physically scarred.
   Luckily for Kate she has two incredible friends to help her through it.
   During a trip to Ireland and Scotland she discovers something about
   herself. I won't say too much more since I don't want to ruin the
   story.
   This story is an emotional roller coaster. At times I was laughing and
   then I would plunge into sadness. Kate is the type of character that
   readers cheer for. She's vulnerable, but determined, witty, but also
   clueless, and quite lovable. It you enjoy stories about the power of
   love don't miss this one.
   I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

   Without a doubt Ria MacAlister brings to the forefront the horrific
   abuse that goes on between spouses and partners. The story was riveting
   and the reader is more than satisfied with the ending when the victim
   becomes the victor. I couldn't put the book down until I knew things
   were going to be all right again.

   BALINESE police have told a Gold Coast mum her son is dead after a body
   matching his description washed ashore, but Luciana Viera is refusing
   to give up hope.

   Fernando Campello, 24, has been missing for six days and Balinese
   police said a body washed up on Lombok Island two days ago is likely
   his.

   “They found a body yesterday and they got us to identify it but it was
   not him,” she said.

   “He is still alive.

   “The body had been in the water for weeks and he has only been missing
   for days. There were no tattoos on the body so I know it was not him.

   “They want a DNA test but I do not trust them.”

   Ms Viera said she had begged the Australian foreign embassy to attend
   the DNA test with her but was rejected because Mr Campello was
   travelling on a Brazilian passport.

   “I am really scared because I do not trust the police here,” she said.

   “I want an Australian doctor or a Brazilian doctor to come with me
   while I do it.”

   The Brazilian national went missing from his hotel room in Gili
   Trawangan, one of a group of three islands east of Bali.

   Balinese police were still searching after Ms Viera failed to identify
   the corpse.

   “I was speaking to the mum yesterday and she was crying,” said an
   officer who would only be named as Natamoken.

   “I am looking and the policemen are still looking on this island and
   all over Gili Islands.

   “I am telling people to bring the body to Gili if they find it because
   the mum is here.”

   Mr Campello had said he was worried about flying before heading
   overseas last year.

   Mr Campello and his friend Andre Romano, 24, left Australia in December
   on an Air Asia flight just one day after AirAsia flight 8501 plummeted
   into the ocean killing all 162 people on board.

   “No one knows what’s going on and that is the most worrying thing,”
   said Mr Campello at Gold Coast Airport moments before he was shuttled
   to his AirAsia flight to begin what was supposed to be the trip of a
   lifetime.

   Mr Romano said at the time that they would not let fear halt their
   trip. They were travelling to Kuala Lumpur.

   “We were very afraid when we first heard,” Mr Romano said. “We were
   trying not to think about it because we will be catching heaps more
   planes in our lives. We wouldn’t let it ruin our trip.”

   Mr Campello survived the flight, but two months later his family and
   numerous Australian authorities are desperately searching for any sign
   of the missing Brazilian.

   Ms Viera said her son went missing after consuming an alcoholic drink
   and falling sick.

   She said he was last seen walking back to his hotel on Gili Trawangan.

   A friend who walked back to the hotel room with Mr Campello said the
   young man had become paranoid and started to hear voices.

   The next morning his hotel room was empty.

   More concerning, Ms Viera said local authorities had refused to search
   nearby caves fearing “evil spirits”.

   It is the second tragedy to rock the Gold Coast’s Brazilian community
   with the alleged tomahawk murder of pregnant Fabiana Palhares on
   Monday.

   AUSTIN, TEXAS, FEBRUARY 4, 2015 - Bearhawk Aircraft announced today two
   firsts for its Bearhawk Patrol aircraft kits: 1) The first flight of a
   completed Bearhawk Patrol in South Africa, and 2) The first shipment of
   a Bearhawk Patrol kit to Brazil. The Bearhawk Patrol, available as a
   Quick-Build kit, is a two-place tandem seated aircraft resembling the
   Piper Super Cub. It differs notably by its single-strut-braced wings
   and an advanced airfoil. These developments come shortly after the
   company publicly debuted its new Bearhawk LSA, a slightly smaller
   design that meets Sport Pilot requirements.

   The first Bearhawk Patrol, ZU-HUB, to fly in South Africa has now
   logged 27+ hours. Owned by South African Bearhawk distributor, Wayne
   Giles, ZU-HUB is turning heads in the region. Giles is reporting a fast
   cruise of 155 mph indicated at 75-percent power. The Patrol has a
   Superior IO-360 engine that develops 180 hp while swinging a
   three-bladed composite propeller from MT-Propeller.

   Mark Goldberg, president of Bearhawk Aircraft, commented, "What is
   surprising the aviation community of South Africa is the Patrol's fast
   cruise speed while still being able to land and takeoff as short as a
   PA-18 Super Cub." The Patrol's speed is attributed to the Riblett
   30-413.5 airfoil design and flush riveted wings. Commending Giles on
   his completion of the aircraft, Mark added, "Beautiful job Wayne!"

   Giles' son (a film major) produced a video of the aircraft's first
   flight; it can be viewed at [42]http://youtu.be/Ftj8foKVR2M. Photos of
   the first Bearhawk Patrol in Africa included one of the finished
   aircraft and Giles' "esteemed helper Mattheus." Wayne added he is "very
   pleased with the outcome and end result of the aeroplane we built
   together!" The South African Patrol was completed in two years,
   following delivery of the kit.

   Meanwhile across the Atlantic, the first Bearhawk Patrol Quick-Build
   kit was shipped to a customer in Brazil. A rancher from Santa Catarina
   province in southern Brazil, Fernando Frahm took a demo flight at
   AirVenture Oshkosh 2014, whereupon he decided to purchase the Patrol.
   Frahm knew it was the airplane he needed to land at the short strip on
   his ranch. It would also allow him greater travel flexibility at better
   cruise speeds than similar STOL/utility aircraft he had been
   considering.

   The Brazilian customer requested that the majority of items to complete
   his Quick-Build kit be packed in the shipping container. This is a
   common occurrence with overseas deliveries. Sourcing parts is more
   easily done is the U.S., and Bearhawk Aircraft is able to simplify
   shipping, customs and other considerations on behalf of its customers.
   For example, in late 2014, the company held a shipment while waiting
   for PolyFiber fabric covering supplies and Grove wheels/brakes to
   arrive. Goldberg commented, "We are always willing to help them out."
   Bearhawk aircraft kits have been exported to many countries around the
   globe, including: Canada, Ecuador, Brazil, Germany, Norway, South
   Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.

   Bearhawk Aircraft manufactures high-quality Quick-Build aircraft kits
   for the Bearhawk 4-Place, and two-place tandem Bearhawk Patrol and
   Bearhawk LSA. Designed by engineer Bob Barrows, the Bearhawks have in
   common excellent performance and superb flying characteristics.
   Bearhawks are known for their short field capability, higher than
   expected cruise speeds, and very gentle slow speed manners. For utility
   and recreational use, Bearhawk aircraft are flown by customers around
   the world.

   The Oregon State football Twitter account teased this just before 7
   a.m. Wednesday:

     Lots and lots of cheers from inside the coaches' offices. Find out
     soon why. [174]#goebavs [175]#FutureBeavs15
     -- Beavers Football (@OSUBeaversFB) [176]February 4, 2015

   Shortly after, the program announced that Paul Lucas, a three-star
   all-purpose back from Phoenix Mountain Pointe, had flipped his
   commitment from Arizona State to sign with the Beavers.

     [177]#FutureBeavs15: Help us welcome Paul Lucas, a Wide Receiver
     from Phoenix, Ariz., to [178]#BeaverNation [179]#GoBeavs
     [180]pic.twitter.com/JnCtibu1vZ
     -- Beavers Football (@OSUBeaversFB) [181]February 4, 2015

   OSU lists Lucas as a receiver, a position without a commitment heading
   into Signing Day. Rivals rates the speedy Lucas as a the No. 9
   all-purpose back in the country, making him an intriguing piece as the
   Beavers move toward more of a spread offense.

   Lucas had originally committed to the hometown Sun Devils on Christmas.
   He also had offers from Arizona, Nebraska, Notre Dame, Tennessee, Utah,
   UCLA and Washington.

   Foreign Investment in Mombasa
   Wednesday, 1st April 2015
   A favorite and a major foreign investment destination especially in the
   real-estate market, Mombasa hosts substantial number of foreigners from
   Asia, Europe, United States and even from Australia.  So, where in
   Mombasa do these expatriates or foreigners live? Mombasa has
   established its name as a cultural port town that has been able to
   withstand numerous invasions and occupations by foreigners from
   overseas countries.
   The Japanese Yen: The Next Currency Set to Fail
   Tuesday, 31st March 2015
   With poor demographics and an unsustainable debt, Japan is headed for a
   crash.  The victim? The Japanese yen, which will not survive the
   impact.
   Foreign Investment in Nairobi
   Monday, 30th March 2015
   Many expatriates and foreign investors set up camp in Nairobi due to
   the city's advanced infrastructure and easy entry into and out of the
   country.  In addition to strong rental yields and growing real-estate
   industry, Nairobi's has it all: Chinatown, Little Mogadishu and even
   Nairobi's very own Beverly Hills.  As much as anybody, both local and
   foreign, can live anywhere, more often than not, foreign investors from
   the same region or country invest in one area of the city to be around
   other Europeans, Indians, Chinese, Somalis or Americans.
   Rental Markets in Nairobi
   Monday, 30th March 2015
   Nairobi has the highest rental yields in Kenya generating up to 10 and
   12 times more when compared with other urban and rural areas.  The
   rental market in Nairobi has been so lucrative that even indecent
   dwelling units, such as slums and squatter settlements, are attracting
   rent as much as Ksh2,500 for 10 by 10 single rooms.  The recent
   increase in rental costs in Nairobi has made the city one of the most
   lucrative property markets worldwide.

Drive Your Bass with This Programmable DI Box!

   Tech 21, the SansAmp people, have come up with the Programmable Bass
   Driver DI, a 3-channel, programmable, rig-in-a-box for bassists who
   can't get enough of a great thing. Like the TRI-A.C. for guitar, the
   Bass Driver DI offers three hot tones right at your toetips. The
   all-analog circuitry features the same controls as its single channel
   predecessor: Drive, Bass, Treble, Presence, Blend and Level. Digital
   only in its programmability, you just tweak the knobs until you find a
   tone, double-tap on a footswitch, and it's saved in that channel. It's
   that simple. Three of your favorite tones - to go!

   Tech 21 Programmable Bass Driver DI Features:
     * 3-channel programmable DI box especially for bass instruments
     * Drive, Bass, Treble, Presence, Blend and Level controls
     * Go live with just your Bass Driver DI straight into the PA
     * Bounce into any studio with a Programmable Bass Driver DI and plug
       directly into the board
     * While larger than other SansAmp pedals, the Programmable Bass
       Driver DI still fits into a gig bag
     * Actual size is 7.25" L x 5" W x 2" H.
     * Roadworthy all-metal construction, yet weighs a mere 25 oz.
     * Operable with a 9-volt alkaline battery or optional Tech 21 DC2
       power supply, and also phantom powerable

   Live or in the studio, you'll get a kick out of the Programmable Bass
   Driver DI!

Sansamp prog driver DI

   by Noah Watkins from United States
   Music Background: Bassist and instructor
   April 1, 2015
   I purchased the sansamp programmable bass driver from sweetwater and oh
   my goodness!!! its amazing! I use a fender dimension v and it made the
   bass sound even better!! and I don't use amps on stage (they are
   backlined and for stage volume only) and it sounds so good! sounds
   really organic and can cut thru just beautifully. I do lots of
   different genres, from pop,metal,rock, to punk and everywhere in
   between. Sounds so good! sound guys and FOH love it!! makes there job
   so much easier plus the 3 channels is perfect and the DI out is so
   clean (no hum or buzz) its perfect! recommend any and all bass players
   this pedal!

A super easy pedal to use !!!

   Music Background: Amp tech. Pro musician

   Super easy to use and program. Even an analog man can program it !!!!
   Great results. Easy to tweak on the fly. Probably the easiest piece of
   gear I own to use

Missing for all these years

   by Brett from United States
   Music Background: Bass Player, Recording
   September 12, 2012
   I have been aware of these bass pre-amps that Tech 21 makes for at
   least 15 years, but never thought I needed one. My hartke bass
   amplifier seemed to have all the doo-hickeys I needed to shape my tone
   but I have recently been dissatisfied with what I have been hearing,
   mostly in the bottom end. My guitar player recommended I get one of
   these because in their words "it makes a bass sound like a bass". They
   weren't kidding. I love this thing.

Awesome

   by Matt DeSear from Tampa, FL
   Music Background: Pro musician and recording engineer
   March 1, 2012
   I'm a upright bass player that uses a piezo pickup. This unit makes my
   bass sounds tight, full, and rich. It lacks these qualities with out
   this unit. It has fully ajustable EQ, and a mix between the samsamp and
   pure instrument signal. I program one channel for pizzicato and the
   other for my bow. The last one I save for my j bass. I don't plug my
   bass in with out the samsamp tech 21.

     Sweetwater has my business from now on. I got to talk to actual
     people quickly. They beat everyone's price, and their service was
     outstanding! My guitar was exactly what I wanted and got here fast!
     The price is the best out there. The service folks and salesmen were
     extremely friendly and personal. I'd say that I will be doing a lot
     more business with Sweetwater.

Carrie Writes: Healthy lifestyle choices help prevent heart disease

   CHILI-2 0211
   A healthy diet, rich in vegetables and fiber, can help fight heart
   disease. (ASSOCIATED PRESS / FILE PHOTO)
   [110]Print
   [111]Carrie Barrepski By [112]Carrie Barrepski The Republican
   on February 04, 2015 at 9:27 AM, updated February 04, 2015 at 9:28 AM

   February is considered heart and stroke awareness month by the American
   Heart Association.

   According to the association, heart disease is the number one killer of
   women. Prevention can be as simple as keeping regular doctor’s
   appointments and making healthy life choices.

   The association recommends following a low-fat and high-fiber diet. It
   also recommends at least 150 minutes of physical exercise per week.

   Another tip is to learn how to manage stress and take care of yourself.

   I have always taken a healthy approach to life, especially since I have
   had congenital heart disease since birth. In the recent years I have
   become more self-aware due to having a successful heart valve
   replacement surgery.

   The key to good health is to be mindful, which is the practice of being
   aware of our mind, body and surroundings. This involves feeling the
   effects of our actions from eating to exercise.

   I have always practiced mindfulness to stay connected to myself since
   it helps guide me through everyday life. To keep myself mindful I
   meditate every morning to keep me focused and connected.

   Every day I practice vinyasa yoga, connecting breath with movement. It
   is a great way to work out that leaves me feeling healthy and
   energized.

   I also include a Pilates and ballet session to help tone my body. I
   always enjoy my daily workouts; it is my favorite time and activity of
   the day.

   Another important component to being healthy is eating in moderation.
   Practicing mindfulness can help determine what foods to eat, when we’re
   hungry and how much to eat.

   I follow a low fat semi-vegetarian plan. My diet consists of
   vegetables, beans, whole grains and fruits.

   To me being healthy is a lifestyle choice. We should treat our bodies
   as temples, fueling them and taking care of them.

5 tips to help get the weight off :: my weight loss journey {#WWSponsored
#WeightWatchers}

   “This post was created as part of a relationship in which I was
   sponsored by Weight Watchers and given a free three month subscription
   to try their new Personal Coaching product and write about my
   experience. Though I was compensated for my time and commitment, all
   views, positive and negative, are my own. #WeightWatchers #WWsponsored

   My weight loss has not been substantial at this point. But, that’s ok.
   I am not in this for quick loss and then gaining it back. I am looking
   for long term, healthy changes in my life…to last me the REST of my
   life. That being said, I wanted to share with you 5 things I have been
   doing to help keep me focused. Help keep me driving towards my goal.
   The goal I set up in my Weight Watchers account and keep watching it on
   a weekly basis!

   I am using [45]Weight Watchers this time around for several reasons,
   however, one of the biggest reasons is because it’s SO. MUCH. MORE.
   than just a diet program. They are humans making me feel even more like
   a better human. The personal coaching is uplifting me, making me feel
   ok when I fail, yet pushing me a little so I can pick up where I left
   off.

   You guys, I love the [46]personal coaching!! {big, puffy heart love!!}

   All right, enough of the mushy, mushy talk, let’s talk about some
   things YOU can do to achieve your weight loss success!!

   Have a scheduled day to weigh in each week…same day, same time. You
   wouldn’t think it would make a difference, but it does when it comes to
   the time of day. I always do it first thing in the morning – I go to
   the bathroom, then grab the scale. Clockwork.

   Track, track, and track some more. I don’t know about you, but if I
   know that I’m going to have to write something down, if it’s going to
   be solidified in black ink in a notebook or in my app, I hesitate to
   eat it. Might seem silly, but YOU try it! If you know that you are
   going to have to add a peanut butter cup to your app, and then it’s
   going to generate automatically the points in which you just consumed,
   I’m betting you will hesitate to eat it. That tip alone has saved me a
   TON of calories lol!! My tip…right now you can get a steal on
   calendars. Yes, you can get one that has a hefty price tag on it, and
   to each his own. But, I picked mine up in the dollar section at Target,
   y’all!! Boo-yah!! It’s perfect because there is space for each day, so
   I can put some food as well as my work-outs. It’s mainly for my
   work-outs to be honest, I like the Weight Watchers app to track my
   food. :)
   blank pages in your book

   Prep ahead. It’s hard to plan. Like REALLY hard for me. That has been
   my biggest challenge, and when I don’t plan and prep, I find myself
   grabbing snacks all day long…nothing of substance and only things that
   will leave me longing for more food. When I DO plan ahead, I have
   healthy snacks and meals all set and ready to roll. I have been trying
   to do this on the weekend, when my husband is around to help monitor
   the children and make sure they are staying safe lol! My advice for you
   is to do it when you can stay focused. I like to sit down at the
   computer and check out the meal section of the Weight Watchers site.
   The meals are FABULOUS and give huge direction. Not every one of them
   is up my alley, but I’m able to sort and pick from difficult to create
   to easy. I opt for easy 9 times out of 10.

   Have a great support system. Whether it’s your spouse or significant
   other or a family member or a friend. Having someone you can talk to
   about things whenever you need to, is HUGELY important! If you don’t
   have a good support system, that is where I find the PERSONAL COACHING
   is beyond fabulous. I have stuck with the same gal, and I love it. You
   can totally switch it up, but the gal I picked meshes well with me.
   They have a little bio when you are reading about the personal coaches.
   I picked one that was in to running, because when I do workout, the
   food is what gets me. I want to eat everything in sight! I needed
   someone that understood this. Outside of my husband, she is my other
   part of the support system. She lifts me up and points things out that
   I may have not see. Crucial!! Oh yes…one more thing. Sorry, I keep
   adding, but this is a great point too! There is 24/7 help via the
   Weight Watchers app and online too! Just one click and you are on your
   way to the help or reassurance you need! Weight Watchers Notifications
   via iPhone

   The last thing, just have more good days than bad days. Period. Don’t
   beat yourself up. Work on loving yourself!! Tomorrow is a new day! Make
   better choices tomorrow and you will feel good!!
   make today better than yesterday quote

   So, talk to me. What are your biggest tips? Or…what are your biggest
   struggles? How are YOU [47]getting healthy this year? I’d love to chat
   about this!!

   stalking of my progress!**

       I tried this program a few years ago, I think I might try it again.
       I worked for me before until I had some health issues.

       Just love personal coaches, however I think you may have to check
       out a few different people to make sure that you get a coach that
       fits your style.

       I love having a personal coach, it’s similar to the support of a 12
       step program. Whenever you need help or someone to talk to they
       will be there for you!

       I have always loved WW. I definitely know for me planning is key.
       If I plan ahead I am less likely to eat things I wouldn’t normally
       eat

       into it more for myself.

   A new study has found that over 30% people are afraid of taking
   [50]pills daily to prevent heart diseases and rather opt for a shorter
   life.

   The study conducted by American [51]Heart Association analysed people
   with an average age of 50 and established that more than 8% of people
   were willing to trade almost two years of their life to avoid taking
   daily medication for cardiovascular disease, whereas 21% would trade
   between one week and a year of their lives.

   In addition to people who were ready to keep their lives at stake,
   there were around 21% of people who said they would pay $1,000 or more
   to avoid taking a pill each day for the rest of their lives.

   There were around 70% of participants who were not interested to trade
   any weeks of their lives to avoid taking a CVD pill daily, and 62%
   weren't willing to gamble any risk of immediate death.

   Robert Hutchins, MD, MPH, lead author said that the act of having pills
   on daily basis can have a large effect on an individual's quality of
   life, and even a small reductions in quality of life like those found
   in this study, can have very large effects on the cost-effectiveness of
   that drug for a population.

   The study is published in Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes journal
   of American Heart Association.

visitation of the ghost

   i'm THE WORINDLVE, but i also go by tomas, kazumi and red. i'm a cool
   ghost, here to haunt your cool house. you can give me nicknames if you
   want (tommy, for example).

   [1]buddy and [2]sam are my tender gay family and i love them

   my pronouns are it / its + they / them / their + he / him / his. you
   can use neutral or traditionally masculine language to refer to me,
   including language referring to me as a thing. pronouns are in order of
   preference, though generally i don't care which you use.

   i'm mixed-race (filipino, japanese, white) and gray-aromantic
   asexual. i also identify as bi. i am 15. i am an artist. i am also an
   abuse survivor, so i will talk about abuse sometimes. expect talk of
   social issues.

   as for fandom-related stuff, i will talk about video games and not much
   else. it's generally "whatever i'm playing right now" that comes up,
   which changes from month to month.

   i am autistic and have anxiety, depression and ADHD. these will come up
   rather frequently as well.

   if we're in a mutual you may follow my locked twitter

   中は別の所属で銃を持たないとか
   （カナダの国会と同じとわざわざカナダの国会へのテロ映像もあり）
   代わりにこういう対処をしてるとか

   2015年2月4日 15時24分
   テレビ朝日がYouTube上に開設しているニュース動画配信チャンネル「ANNnewsCH」が2月4日時点でアカウント停止処分になっている。
   アクセスすると、「暴力に関するYouTubeのポリシーに複数回のまたは重大な違反をしたため、このアカウントを停止しました」と表示されるだけだ。

   バックは間違いなく飢餓朝鮮＋下朝鮮＋在日＋日本赤軍＆それに連なる支援者＋日本国内阿呆左翼だけどね。
   これって、放送したからより、この内容を放送前に既にISILにばらまいている可能性のほうが高い。
   朝日は日本政府の制止振りきって記者を派遣しているってつい数日前問題になったばかりだし。
   つまりはそういう情報をISILに流して、自分らの保護を要求している可能性すら有るんだから。

   外患罪（がいかんざい）は、外国と通謀して日本国に対し武力を行使させ、又は、日本国に対して外国から武力の行使があったときに加担するなど軍事上の利

   オウムの実態が世間に露わになる以前、坂本弁護士の取材ビデオを見せ、活動状況をオウムに教えたのは時のＴＢＳだった。
   これがあの凶行を起こす動機となったのは有名な話だ。当時は個人情報保護法なんて無かったし、情報源の秘匿という最低限のルールも守られなかった。
   これを機に、ワイドショー花盛りの時代にＴＢＳはワイドショー路線を変えた。
   社会問題・事件・事故を執拗に取材してるうちに警察や被害者側に不利となる情報を流してしまうことに気づかない愚鈍さが悲劇的な事件に結びついた結果だ
   。
   視聴率優先、スポンサー優先で番組制作しているＴＶ局、マスメディアは手痛い思いをもう一度味わいたいのかと疑問がわく。これは社会正義に反する行為だ

   しかし、少し考えれば発表しても良いかどうかわかるはずである。
   　つまり番組から降ろされるのを回避するだけの御身大事の人だけの話であり、これは日本のマスコミ全体に言えることである。
   　特にテレ朝はその傾向が高いだけの関西出身放送局である。だから、趣味のテレ東に追い上げを喰っているわけである。

   5.0 out of 5 stars [81]a good addition to the afobos catalog October
   16, 2013
   By [82]Dr Ghoul
   Format:Kindle Edition
   so far i've enjoyed all of afobos's writings. he never fails to
   entertain and intrigue. there were many instances in this book that got
   my heart pumping with anticipation and i kept wondering what would
   happen. if you enjoy a good action filled story then you will also
   enjoy vrikolakas. looking forward to see how it all continues with a
   hopeful vrikolakas 2.

   Afobos
   My name is Afobos, and I'm originally from Greece. My family immigrated
   to the states in the late 60's and I've lived here since. I've always
   loved writing and have written quite a few things mostly for my own
   pleasure, and I just now started looking into publishing my work. I
   started by publishing a small anthology of some of my poems or stories
   here at Amazon, as well as a sci-fi novel that is the first in a
   series. The second and third parts are out as well.
   There is also The God Inside Trilogy, the complete series in one book
   out as well. Everything is also available in paperback.
   I also have a book out called: Zen and the Art of Massage. It's a
   spiritual type book and not a how to massage book.
   I also have a sci-fi novel called: I, IMMORTAL. It's the story of Aris
   a 12,000 year old immortal and his path down the long road of time as
   seen through his own eyes.
   My next book is called: Devolution and it's the story of humanity
   facing its extinction through a deadly virus that destroys most of the
   human race living very few humans to try and make a come back from the
   verge of extinction.
   It's selling right now for $2.99 at amazon.
   I also have a book out called Autokinesis, and it's about special
   abilities, and the small club that forms from people who are special in
   unique ways. If you like the show heroes then you'll like this. It's
   selling for $2.99 as well.
   The Body Glove which has proven to be my best seller is out on Amazon
   right now, and it's the story of an unusual friendship between a young
   man and an alien, and how their partnership creates a superhero that's
   bigger than both of them. It's selling for $2.99.
   The sequel is out as well and it takes a twist into the realm of horror
   by introducing a zombie virus into the mix.
   The latest book I've written is my first attempt at a vampire novel and
   it's called Vrikolakas which is the Greek word for Vampire. I didn't
   know how hard it would be for English speakers to handle that word but
   I used it anyway.
   It's the story of Jason, a 2,600 year old vampire from Sparta.
   Available for $2.99 on Amazon.
   If you like bike stunts I also have a home made DVD here at Amazon for
   rent or purchase here's the link:

   I have three videos on my author's page here at Amazon.
   The first is me working out with the chucks in my backyard on a hot
   Texas summer's day. My character in The God Inside is proficient with
   the chucks so I thought I'd add that video.
   I have another video which is me talking about my books.
   There is yet one more video that is me reading the first chapter in the
   upcoming book Zen and the Art of Massage.
   I'm a massage therapist and have been practising for the past 17 years
   and one day I'll get it right! 8)
   I live 30 minutes south of Houston in League City TX with my 3 indoor
   cats and outside I have possums racoons and lots of squirrels for
   company.
   I enjoy kayaking, (Lots of places for that around here. It's known as
   the Bayou city...) riding sport bikes, the occasional windsurfing, and
   never ending battle of the bulge and trying to get in shape. I used to
   be a bodybuilder back in the 80's and it kind of fizzled from
   there...8)
   I have worked in a lot of different fields ranging from pizza delivery
   driver to cook, to teaching English as a foreign language, teaching
   Greek, Interpeter, selling ladie's shoes, private security, bodyguard,
   delivery driver, etc.... Something about working for someone else
   though has never agreed with me. I guess you can't fire yourself, that
   why I like to work for myself. 8)
   I speak fluent Greek, a bit of Spanish which I learned from ex wife's
   family, a little German, and you can catch my accent when I
   mispronounce words like sheets and sheep.... I'll let you guess what
   sheet sounds like when I pronounce it...8)
   In my line of work (massage therapy) I've learned to replace sheets
   with linens. Cuts down on stunned looks. 8)
   My web site for my massage business is:

   Social Leaders: Spreading the Fire of Social Business

      It’s always fun turning the page on a new year. It gives us a chance to
      audit the past year, to take stock of what worked, what didn’t and what
      has run its course. After all, to anticipate what’s to come, we can’t
      lose sight of what’s already come to pass. In 2014, we spent the year
      celebrating the dawning social employee revolution. This year, we will
      celebrate the next phase of that revolution: the rise of the social
      leader.

      The idea of the social leader first made splashes late last year, when
      The Economist Intelligence Unit (@[105]TheEIU), sponsored by IBM
      (@[106]IBM), released its list of the
      [107]Top 25 Social Business Leaders. It was my great pleasure to serve
      on the [108]advisory board charged with determining the list, each
      member of which is a true social leader in their own right.


   So what is a social leader?


      In determining our 25 social leaders, the first task was establishing
      the proper [109]criteria: Social leaders are visionaries, strategic
      thinkers, culture shapers, storytellers, adaptive, entrepreneurial and
      fully social. These concepts are bound to mean different things to
      different people, but I think the best social leaders succeed because
      they have a clear idea of what these concepts mean to them, and how
      they can be used to distinguish themselves in business communities.

      But what do these terms mean to me, and why do I think recognizing
      social leaders is so important? I addressed these questions in greater
      detail in [110]a discussion with The Economist, but ultimately, I think
      it comes down to this: For most modern professionals, our career paths
      are no longer linear. We generally don’t stay with the same company all
      our lives, nor do we always occupy the same roles. If we are to
      maintain control of our professional destinies, we must work not only
      to demonstrate our value, but also to demonstrate our engagement in
      communities relevant to our fields.


   Where we’ve been—and where we’re going


      Of course, it’s important to understand that social leadership is a
      journey. You don’t just decide to become a social leader and transform
      overnight. By its very nature, social engagement is an ongoing process
      of knowledge sharing and community building.

      Just ask social business guru Tom Peters (@[111]tom_peters), whose
      concept of “BrandYou” nearly 20 years ago was the blueprint for what we
      consider social leadership today. Simply put, our behaviors determine
      how our professional communities see us. By taking control of this
      narrative, we not only empower ourselves in our own careers, but we
      also help raise the profile and value of both our coworkers and our
      parent brand.

      This conversation is ongoing, with many others championing Peters’s
      cause and adding their own insights to the process. And according to
      Kevin Randall (@[112]KevinBrandall), Vice President, Strategy &
      Planning at [113]Movéo, and New York Times writer, the release of
      [114]The Social Employee (McGraw-Hill, 2013), co-written by Mark
      Burgess (@[115]MNBurgess) and myself, has helped to amplify that
      message.

      (Click [117]here for full Economist article.)


      Of course, we couldn’t have helped to spread the fire if Kevin wasn’t
      there to fan the flames. The insights offered in his stellar afterword
      for The Social Employee were spot-on, and his continued evangelism on
      the subject offers a powerful model of what social leadership is all
      about.

Apple Raises $6.5 Billion From Bond Sale Funding Share Buybacks

   Don't Miss Out —
   Follow us on:

   by [78]Cordell Eddings
   12:01 AM EST
   February 3, 2015

   (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is showing it can keep coming back to the
   bond market to fund share buybacks and preserve its overseas cash
   hoard.

   The iPhone maker sold $6.5 billion in debt Monday in a deal that was
   bigger than it initially intended with borrowing costs that are some of
   its lowest ever. The offering included 30-year debt with a 3.45 percent
   coupon, or 0.3 percentage point less than the record-low yield
   investors demanded on Friday to own similar corporate debt with
   comparable maturities.

   Apple has now raised the equivalent of $39 billion from the bond market
   in less than two years, bringing the company closer to fulfilling a
   pledge to boost the value of its stock amid pressure from billionaire
   activist investor Carl Icahn. Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told
   analysts last week that the Cupertino, California-based company has
   completed $103 billion of it $130 billion capital returns plan.

   “Apple has proven itself to be pretty thoughtful and shrewd when it
   comes to capital allocation over the last couple of years, and that
   hasn’t been lost on the bond market,” said Scott Kessler, a technology
   analyst at S&P Capital IQ in New York. “It makes sense for them to be
   active participants in the corporate bond market.”

   Apple has been turning to bonds instead of using cash that’s mostly
   held overseas, which would subject it to repatriation taxes. Apple
   ended December with about $178 billion in cash and marketable
   securities, according to a company statement on Jan. 27. Of that $157.8
   billion were held by foreign subsidiaries.

Investors Rewarded

   Investors have been rewarded well for owning Apple bonds, which have
   returned 13.7 percent since the end of 2013, outperforming the 10.3
   percent gain in debt of similarly rated companies, according to Bank of
   America Merrill Lynch index data. The extra yield investors demand to
   own the debt has dropped 3 basis points during the same period, even as
   it widened 16 basis points on average for borrowings of companies with
   similar ratings. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.

   Icahn in October renewed pressure on Apple to accelerate the stock
   buybacks, saying its shares are undervalued and should be at $203.
   That’d give Apple a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion.
   Apple’s shares closed at $118.63 in New York Monday.

‘Bullish Signal’

   Apple increased its capital return program to $100 billion in April
   2013, including share buybacks and dividends. The company raised it by
   $30 billion in April last year along with a boost to the dividend and
   split of its stock 7-for-1.

   The new borrowings come after Apple posted a 30 percent jump in fiscal
   first quarter revenue to $74.6 billion on Jan. 27, its largest sales
   increase in three years. Net income rose 38 percent to a record $18
   billion.

   “The borrowing is a bullish signal in the confidence of their
   business,” said Michael Walkley, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity Inc.
   in Minneapolis. “A debt offering is about the sustainability of
   providing strong long-term cash flows, and taking advantage of
   attractively priced financing.”

   Steve Dowling, a spokesman for Apple, didn’t respond to a telephone
   call and e-mail seeking comment on the offering.

   The company issued the securities in five parts, including $2 billion
   of 30-year bonds, Bloomberg data show. The average yield on the
   highest-rated company bonds with maturities of at least 15 years was
   3.76 percent on Jan. 31, according to Bank of America Merill Lynch
   Index data.

   “Apple is getting attractive terms,” Mike Buchanan, the Pasadena,
   California-based head of global credit at Western Asset, said in a
   telephone interview. “The demand for high quality will continue to
   encourage companies to tap the market.”

FAQ

   What platforms can I play The Sims 4 on?
   The Sims 4 can be played on PC and Mac. And because this title supports
   dual entitlement, you can play on either platform with a single
   purchase.
   Is a persistent online connection required to play The Sims 4?
   You’ll need to be online to start The Sims 4 for the first time. Once
   you're all set up, you can take advantage of Origin's Offline Mode and
   play The Sims 4 without an internet connection.
   Will I be able to bring any of my Sims or content from The Sims 3 into
   The Sims 4?
   The Sims 4 has been developed from the start to take advantage of new
   and unique features that were not possible in past editions of The
   Sims. The Sims 4 cannot use characters or content from previous
   versions of The Sims.
   Will I be able to use SimPoints to purchase additional content in The
   Sims 4?
   SimPoints are used to purchase content in The Sims 3 and you can
   continue to buy content for that version of the game. The Sims 4 does
   not use SimPoints for in-game purchases.
   What is the Sims 4 Rewards Program?
   If you own The Sims 3 and any of its Expansion Packs, you may register
   them to unlock bonus digital content in The Sims 4. It’s our way of
   thanking you for your continuing dedication to The Sims!

Android One smartphones will get Lollipop in 'next few weeks', says Google

Google had earlier said that the Android One devices would be among the first
to get the Lollipop update.

   Android One smartphones will get Lollipop in 'next few weeks', says
   Google

   There’s finally some word on when Android One smartphones will be
   getting the Lollipop update. Google India just tweeted that the new
   version of Android will be coming to [113]Android One devices in the
   ‘next few weeks’.

   The Lollipop update for the Android One phones has been awaited for a
   long time now. Google’s Sunder Pichai had announced at the launch that
   these phones will be among the first devices to get the new OS.


     Android One users in India — you’ll be getting the Lollipop update
     in the next few weeks. [114]@androidone
     — Google India (@googleindia) [115]February 4, 2015


   The [116]Android One phones currently include the Micromax Canvas A1,
   Karbonn Sparkle V5 and Spice Dream Uno. Google had also announced that
   nine more companies would be joining the fray in the future, although
   none of them have yet announced an Android One device.

   Also read: [117]Micromax Canvas A1 Review, [118]Karbonn Sparkle V
   Review

   [119]Android One is an initiative by Google to provide value for money
   smartphones at a low price. The devices though don’t seem to be up to
   the task right now, because of their mediocre specifications and the
   lack of marketing initiatives by Google.

   Fast Android updates though could raise the value of these phones
   significantly, since not many phones in the budget range get the update
   soon. In fact, except the [120]Motorola Moto E and [121]Xiaomi Redmi
   1S, Lollipop is not expected in any other smartphones priced under 10k
   anytime soon.

   Q: How long have you been playing together? What clubs do you play?
   Love your music!

   A: Me, the guitar player, and drummer have played together off and on
   for a long time- 30 years! We play clubs around San Diego County.
   Thanks for the compliment- really appreciate it! We're finishing work
   on our CD and will be posting new songs soon. Thanks again for your
   interest! Joe Tavano.

    I give John JOI with a countdown while SPH and CEI before hes allowed
                                   to cum!

     For your dirty mind, I give John jerk off instructions and make him
     stroke his small dick as I countdown from 100. I cum as often as I
     like, but make him wait to cum while i humiliate his little cock. I
        finally decide hes allowed to cum but only if he licks it up
   afterwards, so I tell him exactly how and where to explode his load on
                  the completion of the countdown.  c4s.com

WWW Wednesdays.

   Posted in [18]Books., [19]WWW Wednesday. by [20]Ashley

   [21]img_1384-0

   This is a weekly MEME hosted by [22]Taking on a World of Words. Simply
   answer the following questions. :)

   The three Ws are:
   What are you currently reading?
   What did you recently finish reading?
   What do you think you’ll read next?

   I am currently reading:

   [23]249747 [24]22066090

   Artemis Fowl I am reading on my own and Time’s Edge I am listening to
   the audiobook at work. I always have a book I read on my own and then a
   book that I listen to while working.

   I recently finished reading:

   [25]18108877

   Since it is a new month, I am just going to use what I finished this
   month. I just finished Timebound yesterday and I actually loved it more
   than I thought I would.

   The books I think I’ll read next:

   [26]17331269 [27]20910157

   This month I decided to finally get around to reading the books I
   started and never finished. I started Lost in Babylon about
   SIX months ago and just stopped reading it, so I really want to finish
   that book. I also recently bought Yes Please and want to read that next
   because I have been dying to read it. I read a few pages of it, but
   decided to hold off on it until I finished the books I got from the
   library. I haven’t found the audiobook I’m gonna listen to next.

   What are you currently reading? Finished reading? Reading next?

       I haven’t read Artemis Fowl in ages but I LOVED it when I did read
       it. This is the second time I’ve see Poehler’s book on a WWW today!
       I hope you enjoy it. Thanks for joining the community!

            I haven’t read much (maybe 40 pages) of Artemis Fowl yet, but
            so far I like it and I’m excited about reading it. Thank you!
            :)

   The fight for the soul of the Internet took a major turn Wednesday, as
   Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler's aggressive
   plan to keep the Internet open and neutral encountered enthusiastic
   support and threats of legal challenges.

   After Wheeler outlined his plan to apply decades-old rules to label
   Internet service providers as public utilities, broadband Internet
   providers and their supporters quickly labeled it as unnecessary
   regulation that would stifle innovation. They vowed to thwart the plan
   via lawsuits and other tactics.

   His backers — a diverse group ranging from Netflix and Google to an
   array of consumer groups — expressed their staunch approval in e-mails,
   comments and posts on Facebook and Twitter, reflecting the passion that
   net neutrality stirs among many.

   The FCC is scheduled to vote on the proposal, which would prohibit
   content providers from paying for faster service, on Feb. 26. The plan
   will be circulated to the other FCC commissioners on Thursday.

   It was an inauspicious day for the broadband industry, but not a
   surprising one. That Wheeler wants to apply the Title II authority for
   new net neutrality rules — named after the Title II of the
   Communications Act of 1934 — has been widely anticipated by industry
   watchers in recent weeks.

   President Obama said late last year that he favored the Title II
   option. Wheeler also indicated that he was leaning toward the approach
   at the CES trade show in Las Vegas last month. The FCC's previous net
   neutrality rules were tossed out by a federal court last year.

   Wheeler's proposal would mostly ban content providers from paying cable
   Internet companies, phone companies and wireless carriers to buy faster
   Internet "lanes" for their material, a practice known as "paid
   prioritization." ISPs also specifically will be prohibited from
   blocking or deliberately slowing access to legal content.

   Questions and answers about Obama's open Internet plan

   "Using (the Title II) authority, I am submitting to my colleagues the
   strongest open internet protections ever proposed by the FCC," Wheeler
   wrote in a story posted Wednesday on Wired.com. "These enforceable,
   bright-line rules will ban paid prioritization, and the blocking and
   throttling of lawful content and services. I propose to fully apply —
   for the first time ever — those bright-line rules to mobile broadband."

   "My proposal assures the rights of internet users to go where they
   want, when they want, and the rights of innovators to introduce new
   products without asking anyone's permission," he wrote.

   Wheeler's proposal will refrain from adopting some Title II provisions
   that don't apply to ISPs. To encourage Internet providers to invest,
   Wheeler also said he'll "modernize" Title II and "tailor it for the
   21st century."

   Michael Powell: Stop the Internet Iron Curtain

   The FCC will not regulate pricing and will impose no tariffs or rules
   that would require unbundling of services for consumers, he said. ISPs
   also will be allowed to conduct engineering work related to "reasonable
   network management."

   Some data services that don't go over the public Internet — such as
   voice-over-Internet phones and heart-monitoring services — will not be
   subject to the rules.

   "Today: a big day for the high speed Internet access story in America,"
   tweeted Susan Crawford, a noted net neutrality proponent and author of
   Captive Audience: The Telecom Industry and Monopoly Power in the New
   Gilded Age.

   Wheeler's proposal is hardly the last chapter of the net neutrality
   debate. Several lawmakers in Congress have introduced legislation that
   would regulate the Internet without treating ISPs as public utilities.

   Anticipating the announcement, Hank Hultquist, AT&T vice president for
   federal regulatory, indicated in a blog Monday that legal challenges
   are sure to follow. "Those who oppose efforts at compromise because
   they assume Title II rests on bulletproof legal theories are only
   deceiving themselves," he wrote.

   Verizon's deputy general counsel Michael Glover called Wheeler's
   proposal "unnecessary and counterproductive."

   The draft legislation, mostly supported by Republicans, should be
   sufficient, Glover argued. Wheeler's approach "is unnecessary because
   all participants in the Internet ecosystem support an open Internet,"
   he said. "It is counterproductive because heavy regulation of the
   Internet will create uncertainty and chill investment among the many
   players."

   ISPs have long dreaded the application of Title II, which has more than
   100 pages of text outlining do's and don'ts and would give the FCC
   immense regulatory power.

   Title II allows the FCC to obligate ISPs to open their back-end
   networks to content providers and third-party content-delivery
   companies, they say. It could also require ISPs to sell portions of
   their networks to resellers and require them to file reams of documents
   on their service, they said.

   But proponents say stringent rules are needed, because the cable
   industry is poised for consolidation and many consumers contend with
   local monopolies in broadband Internet service. Without specific rules,
   ISPs would be tempted to ban, slow down or seek payment from content
   providers that compete with a company that has an affiliation or is
   owned by the Internet provider, they argue. For example, Comcast, which
   is trying to buy Time Warner Cable, also owns NBC Universal, which has
   plans to expand streaming shows.

   Net neutrality rules could lead to legal quagmire

   Since he took on the task of recasting net neutrality rules, Wheeler
   and the FCC have been besieged with passionate comments from both sides
   of the debate. The agency has received about 4 million comments, a
   record.

   Wheeler said he also considered using another legal test — a
   determination of "commercial reasonableness" under Section 706 of the
   Telecommunications Act of 1996 — that would adjudicate any net
   neutrality violations on a case-by-case basis. He said he'll use some
   provisions of Section 706, along with Title II.

   [635512351556072797-GTY-458751502.jpg]

   Q&A: Net neutrality — what is at stake?

   "While a recent court decision seemed to draw a road map for using this
   approach, I became concerned that this relatively new concept might,
   down the road, be interpreted to mean what is reasonable for commercial
   interests, not consumers," Wheeler wrote Wednesday.

   Officials at the FCC were mulling over legal implications of several
   options when Obama made his announcement, which may have nudged Wheeler
   to move in the direction of Title II.

   "Congress wisely gave the FCC the power to update its rules to keep
   pace with innovation," Wheeler wrote. "Under that authority my proposal
   includes a general conduct rule that can be used to stop new and novel
   threats to the internet. This means the action we take will be strong
   enough and flexible enough not only to deal with the realities of
   today, but also to establish ground rules for the as yet unimagined."

   AT&T Debuts Unified Communications for Work Teams
   AT&T Debuts Unified Communications for Work Teams

   The telecom giant is working hard to make business collaboration
   easier. AT&T’s latest effort toward that goal is the launch of AT&T UC
   Federation, a [38]cloud-based service that allows suppliers, partners
   and customers to communicate in real-time across various networks.

   AT&T UC Federation is working to overcome a real challenge for
   enterprises that demand dependable collaboration. Disparate unified
   communication (UC) systems have made seamless collaboration difficult
   at best and at times problematic. AT&T is working to tackle these
   challenges by making it possible for internal and external teams to
   collaborate freely across supported UC platforms.

   "Companies that try to set up UC platforms on their own can face
   challenges when creating scalable, secure connectivity that meets
   [39]compliance and support requirements," said Vishy Gopalakrishnan,
   AVP Big Data and Advanced Solutions at AT&T Business Solutions. "UC
   Federation from AT&T provides tools to help overcome this challenge by
   removing the hassle and allowing business teams to connect easily and
   over a highly securely platform."

   Avoiding UC Hiccups

   Created in AT&T Labs, AT&T UC Federation supports a number of UC
   platforms, including Microsoft Lync and [40]Cisco Jabber. The
   technology also promises to give organizations the flexibility and
   [41]security to connect to any supported UC platforms where partners,
   suppliers and vendors are doing business.

   AT&T UC Federation also lets enterprises control which organizations
   can communicate at the company, group or user level and even allows
   certain communication methods, like instant messaging, and blocks
   others, such as online presence. The idea is to let enterprises share
   as much or as little information as they choose.

   AT&T is also promising direct benefits to businesses that are merging
   or creating joint ventures with other businesses. That’s because the
   platform gives customers the flexibility to grow and coexist without
   being limited to a single UC platform. It also helps support
   collaboration without any hiccups when a company switches to a new
   communications platform.

   Just the Beginning

   Some enterprises are already testing the platform. Sonus, a company
   that offers secure real-time communications, has deployed and tested
   AT&T UC Federation. The company is in the midst of a full-service
   rollout.

   "With AT&T UC Federation, our sales team can connect with key contacts
   on the spot, in less time than an e-mail would take," said Michael
   Swade, senior vice president of Worldwide Sales and Marketing, Sonus.
   "It makes collaboration easy, and it truly functions as if each user is
   communicating on the same platform. We can IM and check presence all
   within a secure connection."

   This is just the beginning for the AT&T UC Federation. The company
   plans to extend the platform beyond IM and presence to include calendar
   integration as well as video and voice capabilities later in 2015. AT&T
   also hinted that more UC platforms may also be supported in the future.
   The company is offering a free 90-day trial for UC Federation for up to
   25 users.

Add Luxury to Your Bathroom with Towel Warmers from WarmlyYours-Giveaway

   January 20, 2015 by [59]Kathryn Lavallee [60]394 Comments

   Living in a house that requires quite a bit of fixing up means that I
   really notice the difference adding a new appliance or fixture can make
   to the comfort level of my house. Whether it’s something major like new
   flooring in the living room or something minor like a handy kitchen
   gadget, simple additions to our home don’t just improve the look, they
   help to make everyday life feel almost like a vacation.

   That’s exactly the experience I had recently when I got the chance to
   review the Barcelona Towel Warmer from [61]WarmlyYours. I have to admit
   that as much as I’ve sometimes coveted a towel warmer, I likely
   wouldn’t have ever gone out and bought one. Not only can they be quite
   pricey, but they also take up extra space and our tiny bathroom just
   doesn’t have a whole lot of that to spare.

   [62]warmlyyours barcelona

   That’s why the Barcelona Towel Warmer was such a perfect choice for me.
   The freestanding rack-style warmer is nice and thin, making it perfect
   even for our small bathroom. It also works as storage for towels since
   I can have about four hanging on the rack at all times. But the real
   luxury happens when I turn it on with a simple flick of a switch just
   before entering the shower. When I hop out, the towels I use to dry
   myself off are so warm and cozy it’s like they were just pulled out of
   the dryer.

   This towel warmer is inexpensively priced at just $300 and adds
   undeniable luxury to my house. Even better, I’ve also found other uses
   for the towel warmer. We’ve been enjoying unusually mild weather this
   winter, but the downside is that warmer temperatures often mean my boys
   come home with their winter gear completely soaked from playing outside
   with friends. The Barcelona has been the ideal solution for quickly and
   thoroughly drying wet mittens, scarves and ski pants. And because it’s
   a freestanding device, I can even move it into the living room during
   wet weather so that it’s easily accessible for hanging up winter gear.

   WarmlyYours wants to help you add extra comfort and luxury to your home
   too, so the company is very generously offering one lucky Mommy Kat and
   Kids reader their own [64]Barcelona Towel Warmer, a $300 value! To
   enter to win, just leave a blog comment about your favourite feature of
   this towel warmer.

   Since our house is over 100 years old, it has a few issues with
   improper insulation, something that causes it to be a little chilly in
   the winter. I used to almost dread getting out of the nice warm shower
   and ending up cold and shivering, but now that I can wrap myself up in
   a toasty warm towel I don’t mind at all. It’s a little thing that makes
   a big difference! Check out the collection of towel warmers available
   at WarmlyYours and see which one might be best for your house. You’ll
   love the luxury it adds to your bathroom!

       Love that you simply flick a switch and by the time you’re done
       your shower, your towels are warm! Also love how many racks it has.

   'Big Hero 6' Further Merges Disney With Marvel

'Big Hero 6' Further Merges Disney With Marvel

   Since the Disney-Marvel Union began, people have wondered if Disney was
   going to make their own adaptation of a Marvel property. Turns out,
   "their own adaptation" is rather different to the original.

   After [24]Disney bought Marvel, bringing the Avengers in-house, it
   didn't take long before producers started going through Marvel's
   extensive library of comic books in search of a property to develop
   into an animated adventure. 'Big Hero 6' is the first Disney-Marvel
   animation project. Although critics have wondered just how much Marvel
   is left in the movie.

   Hiro and Baymax were redesigned to be more 'Disney friendly'

   First published in 1998, 'Big Hero 6' was created by Steven T. Seagle
   and Duncan Rouleau in their spare time while they worked on another
   project. It's about a group of politicians and business owners who
   recruit and train a team of agents with superhuman powers for the
   Japanese government.

   Anyone who has seen the movie will immediately recognise that this is
   not the film's plot. Relocated to a Japanese-flavoured America, the
   movie features a group of young computer nerds who create the
   technology they need to take on a marauding villain, in the process
   becoming a team of six heroes. The most fundamental difference is the
   central character Hiro, who in the comic book is 13 when he creates the
   scaly green Baymax himself using downloaded memories from his father.
   In the film Baymax is a cuddly pillow-shaped robot created by the dead
   brother of the 15-year-old Hiro.

   [26]Watch the trailer for 'Big Hero 6' here:

   In other words, Disney merely took the title and character names and
   then created a Disney movie that bears little resemblance to the
   relatively unknown original Marvel comics. On the plus side, this means
   that the books retain their integrity for fans who have yet to discover
   them. On the other hand, it means we'll probably never see an actual
   'Big Hero 6' movie. But Disney is so adept at making entertaining
   movies that no one is likely to complain.

Real-time Web Apps with Volt in Ruby

   [22]Dhaivat Pandya
   [23]Dhaivat Pandya

   volt

   [26]Volt is a slick, new Ruby web framework that aims to blur the line
   between client and server code. The basic idea behind the framework is
   that you can write your client-side code (which is usually Javascript)
   in Ruby using Opal, a Ruby runtime within Javascript. In addition, Volt
   provides some nice ways to relay data between the client-side and the
   server-side. If you’ve used [27]Meteor before, Volt is a very similar
   idea, but there are many portions of Meteor which Volt doesn’t have. I
   think Volt has some real potential. As web apps become more and more
   client-side heavy, it is a pain to have to switch mental context
   between Javascript and Ruby. It’s even more of a pain to figure out how
   to flow simple pieces of data between the client and server. Volt can
   help you get there quickly.

   In this article, I’ll go through how to build an incredibly simple
   bookmark “app” with Volt. The point of this article is to get you up to
   speed with some of the very basics and to get you a feel for how the
   client/server divide works in Volt. Let’s get to it.

   First of all, we need a copy of Volt:
gem install volt

   If you’ve used Rails before, then you’ll find some of the “volt”
   command line arguments pretty familiar. Here’s how we create a new
   project:
volt new volt-example

   You should see a familiar-looking (if you’re a Rails kind of person)
   directory layout:
Gemfile
Gemfile.lock
README.md
app
config
config.ru
lib
spec

   To see what Volt has already set up for us, fire up the web server:
bundle exec volt server

   You should see something like this:

   Volt Web Server

   Alright, so where is this page generated, exactly? If you go into the
   app directory, you should see a “main” directory. Unlike Rails, Volt
   lets you break your webapp up into “components” (this idea is similar
   to the Django style of separation). It automatically defines the “main”
   component for you, so let’s head into that directory. You now see:
assets
config
controllers
models
tasks
views

   If you peek in views/main, you can see the views associated with this
   component. The layout for the views that are part of this component is
   defined in main.html which looks like:
<:Title>
  {{ template main_path, "title", {controller_group: 'main'} }}

<:Body>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="header">
      <ul class="nav nav-pills pull-right">
        <:nav href="/" text="Home" />
        <:nav href="/about" text="About" />
        <:user-templates:menu />
      </ul>
      <h3 class="text-muted">volt-example</h3>
    </div>

    <:volt:notices />

    {{ template main_path, 'body', {controller_group: 'main'} }}

    <div class="footer">
      <p>&copy; Company 2014</p>
    </div>

  </div>

<:Nav>
  <li class="{{ if active_tab? }}active{{ end }}">
    <a href="{{ attrs.href }}">{{ attrs.text }}</a>
  </li>

   The odd looking
   , , etc. are a pretty integral part of how views work in Volt.
   Basically, if you see a tag in the form (note the capitalized first
   letter), it is defining or utilizing a section. In the layout, we are
   defining three sections: , and which include some basic layout and then
   defer to the template of the action we have called. Specifically, these
   are the two lines that call the action templates:
{{ template main_path, "title", {controller_group: 'main'} }}
...
{{ template main_path, 'body', {controller_group: 'main'} }}

   In Volt, wherever we have some code enclosed by {{ and }}, it is
   executed as Ruby using Opal. In this case, we’re using some of the
   variables available in order to pull up the template appropriate for
   the page using this layout. Alright, let’s look at one of these
   templates. Open up app/main/views/main/about.html:
<:Title>
  About

<:Body>
  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>About page...</p>

   That looks pretty simple! Basically, we’re just filling in the sections
   in the layout. Let’s jump back to the template to examine it a bit more
   closely. You might notice that some of tags are in the form
   (note the lowercase first letter). These are not sections; they are
   controls. In a sense, they are like Rails’ template helpers (e.g.
   link_to) since they help you generate some HTML. We’ll see some more of
   those as we continue.

Routes and Adding a View

   Alright, that’s enough knowledge for the timebeing. Let’s get started
   building our bookmarking app. We’ll need one page where the user can
   see the list of bookmarks and add a new one. We’ll deal with the
   functionality as we move along, but first, create a new view and a
   route to go with it. Creating a view is simple; just create the file
   app/main/views/main/bookmarks.html:
<:Title>
  Bookmarks

<:Body>
  <h1>Bookmarks</h1>

   To add the route, we go over to config/routes.rb and the following
   line:
get '/bookmarks', _action: 'bookmarks'

   Annnd, that’s it! You’ll have to restart the server (the author of Volt
   says that soon you won’t have to do this) and then you should see a
   nice page at localhost:3000/bookmarks. In fact, we can make the
   bookmarks action the index by changing the last line of
   config/routes.rb to the following:
get '/', {_action: 'bookmarks'}

   Another neat thing about Volt is that it gives you automatic page
   reloads. If you try changing the contents of
   app/main/views/main/bookmarks.html and then save the file, you will be
   able to see the page reload in the browser.

The Basic Pieces

   Le’ts figure out how to process a form so that we can actually create
   new bookmarks. Subsequently, we want to display these bookmarks nicely
   on a page. Before we do that, it is incredibly important to understand
   a fundamental difference between Volt and Rails. Volt is a sort of MVVM
   (Model View, View Model)) framework, not an MVC framework. In practical
   terms, the view in Volt calls on the controller to get stuff done, not
   the other way around.

   First of all, we need a form. That’s pretty easy, just add the
   following to the
   of bookmarks.html:
<form e-submit="add_bookmark" role="form">
    <div class="form-group">
        <label>New Bookmark</label>
        <input class="form-control" type='text' value="{{ page._new_bookmark._de
scription }}" />
        <input class="form-control" type="text" value="{{ page._new_bookmark._ur
l  }}" />
        <input type="submit" value="Add Bookmark" />
    </div>
</form>

   Alright, some parts of this code are run-of-the-mill, others aren’t. We
   have what seems like a simple form element. However, it has some weird
   attributes, e.g. e-submit. Here, e-submit = "add_bookmark" is telling
   Volt that the add_bookmark method/action in the controller should be
   called when data in this form is submitted. The other two weird lines
   are:
<input class="form-control" type="text" value="{{ page._new_bookmark._descriptio
n }}" />
<input class="form-control" type="text" value="{{ page._new_bookmark._url }}" />

   We are defining text input elements but the magic happens in the value
   field. Within the value = "..." attribute, we are creating a binding.
   When the value of those text elements change, the values of the
   variables page._new_bookmark._description and page._new_bookmark._url
   will change. At this point, this form will do nothing important since
   we haven’t really put anything in the add_bookmark controller action.
   So, open up app/main/controllers/main_controller.rb and the add the
   following as a method:
def add_bookmark
  page._bookmarks << {url: page._new_bookmark._url, description: page._new_bookm
ark._description}
  page._new_bookmark._url = 'URL'
  page._new_bookmark._description = 'Description'
end

   In Volt, this thing called page is a model. It isn’t a model in the
   Rails sense of the word – it doesn’t necessarily have anything to do
   with your database. Instead, a model is a piece of data that the
   frontend and backend can both get. Remember that Volt is not just a
   server-side Ruby framework (such as Rails or Sinatra). The point of
   Volt is that it lets the client-side and server-side interoperate
   pretty seamlessly.

   Back to page. In the form, we’ve bound the variables
   page._new_bookmark._description and page._new_bookmark._url (notice the
   underscores prepending the variable names; using those automatically
   gives us empty models to put data in) to certain form values. In the
   controller code, we can take these variables and use them! Update them
   in the view and the changes to those variables are available in the
   controller. This might not seem all that magical at first glance, but
   the power of the idea comes from the fact that you could create a model
   of any kind in the client and then expect it to show up when you call
   controller code from the view.

   The controller then takes page._bookmarks and puts a Ruby hash inside
   with what represents the data associated with one bookmark in our
   simple webapp. Before we can see the results of our efforts, we need to
   have a bit of code in the view that displays these bookmarks:
<ul class="bookmark-list">
  {{ page._bookmarks.each do |bookmark| }}
  <li>
          <a href="{{ bookmark._url }}">{{ bookmark._descr }}</a>
  </li>
  {{ end }}
</ul>

   Alrighty, head over to “localhost:3000″, you’ll see a pretty plain
   looking form where you can enter a description and a URL, hit enter,
   and see it appear in the list of bookmarks just below.

Persistence

   If you refresh your page after inputting some of those bookmarks,
   you’re in for a nasty suprise: they probably all just vanished. We need
   some way to persist that information.

   Persistence is really easy in Volt, but it does come with a gotcha:
   Volt currently only supports MongoDB if you want to use the
   client-server-sharing magic. You might ask why Volt doesn’t support
   something more “standard”, like Postgres or MySQL. The problem is that
   translating JSON objects to and from multiple SQL tables is quite a
   headache and we’d need an ORM in the middle. Essentially, Volt is part
   of the camp that believes that having that sort of a translationary ORM
   within a web framework is a [28]bad idea.

   If you don’t have a copy of Mongo, it’s pretty easy to get. On Mac OS
   X:
brew install mongodb
mongod

   If you’re on Linux, for our purposes, using the version of Mongo
   available in your distribution’s package manager should be fine. With
   Windows, I’ve found [29]this guide helpful.

   If you head over to db/config/app.rb, you;ll find the following lines
   commented out:
config.db_driver = 'mongo'
config.db_name = (config.app_name + '_' + Volt.env.to_s)
config.db_host = 'localhost'
config.db_port = 27017

   Just bring them back into existence. We’ll need to create a model for
   our bookmarks. Since “models” in Volt aren’t really connected to a
   “CREATE TABLE” SQL command, we don’t really have to specify much. We
   just have to create the file app/main/models/bookmark.rb and drop in:
class Bookmark < Volt::Model
end

   Your database setup is ready to go after a restart of the Volt server.
   We do, however, need to change our view and controller a bit. Remember
   the page._bookmarks array we were putting our bookmarks into? In order
   to make that sync into MongoDB, we just have to change page._bookmarks
   to _bookmarks. Volt will handle the rest.

   Here are the changed lines:
_bookmarks << {url: page._new_bookmark._url, description: page._new_bookmark._de
scription}

{{ _bookmarks.each do |bookmark| }}

   That’s it! Notice how easily we are getting data from the browser to
   Mongo. However, there are a few issues with this approach. This idea of
   database syncing between the client and server came into fashion with
   [30]Meteor. However, Meteor takes the client-server connection a step
   further with a [31]completely client-side implementation of Mongo. In
   addition, Meteor lets your app listen for changes in collections on the
   server and get them pushed directly to the client database. This stuff
   isn’t part of Volt, as far as one can tell from the existing
   documentation. So, Volt’s persistence support isn’t quite as powerful
   as that of Meteor when it comes to real-time applications with live
   data updates.

That’s a Wrap!

   We’ve only scratched the very surface of Volt. In fact, our bookmark
   manager looks a bit…garbage. But, we’ve come far enough to give you a
   taste of what the basic idea of Volt is: closer and easier integration
   between the client and server.

   Thanks for the article on volt smile One thing, in your demo code, when
   you change to using store, you need to either reference store directly
   in the views:

store._bookmarks

   or you need to set the controllers model to be :store

class MainController < Volt::ModelController
  model :store

  ...
end

   Also, Volt has realtime updates like Meteor. We do things a bit
   different implementation, but the end result is the same, updates are
   pushed to clients and the DOM updates when the data changes. Let me
   know if there's anything I can help clarify.

   Again, thanks for the great article!

   Hi Ryan,

   Thanks for the compliments. I had the controller model setting in my
   code but didn't include it in the article - I'll get it changed right
   away.

   The point I was making about Meteor was just pointing out the differing
   implementation; as far as I know, Volt does not have a small
   implementation of MongoDB running in the browser. I can reword it to
   make that more clear.

   Thanks,

   Dhaivat

   Volt looks very interesting. I have held off building anything with it
   so far, but I'm definitely going to follow this tutorial and go from
   there. Great article.

   One funny thing I get - when I enter [57]www.google.com for the url,
   than the actual url I get in the bookmarks list is
   localhost:3000/www.google.com. Any idea as to why this happens?
   [58]dhaivatpandya
   [59]February 7, 2015 [60]dhaivatpandya:

   [61]@estebanrules Thanks!

   [62]@alpop If you add the "http://" at the beginning of the url string,
   that should enter it correctly. Otherwise, it is rendered as a local,
   relative path which is why it opens as
   "localhost:3000/www.google.com/".

WWE News: NXT Superstar Kalisto To Debut As A Gay Hair Stylist On Main
Roster?

   Kalisto NXT WWE Kalisto NXT WWE

   In WWE’s history, superstars have portrayed a wide variety of gimmicks.
   Some are well-received by the WWE Universe, while others are put on the
   metaphorical shelf of distaste. For example, Leo Kruger, in NXT, came
   to the WWE’s main roster as Adam Rose. At first, the crowd popped for
   him, because he was different. Over time, that faded away, and now Rose
   is a jobber for WWE.

   Rose is a guy who had a great gimmick in NXT, but the WWE Creative team
   changed it. Adrian Neville, who is [138]rumored to be coming up to the
   main roster, might get a gimmick change. Instead of having no gimmick
   while being over with the NXT crowd, WWE wants to have him portray a
   “Mighty Mouse” gimmick.

   So far, the WWE fans online don’t care for the idea. However, that time
   has not come yet, so there’s time to change their minds if need be.

   The next man to get [139]called up after Neville is Kalisto. He just
   dropped the NXT Tag-Team titles to Blake and Murphy last week. Upon his
   call-up to Raw and Smackdown, Kalisto is [140]rumored to get a new
   gimmick. According to Reddit user MetsFan4Ever, Kalisto might get a new
   gimmick that will garner a unique reaction from the WWE Universe.

   He reports that WWE is looking for a new masked star to take over with
   Rey Mysterio likely leaving but NXT officials recently tried Kalisto
   out with a new, unmasked gimmick – that of a gay hair stylist.

   Kalisto reportedly did very well in the role and is seriously being
   considered to do that gimmick instead of continuing with the Kalisto
   character.

   Now, if the WWE decides to keep this gimmick on Kalisto, then they will
   certainly be prepared for the different responses from the WWE
   Universe. The last time a WWE superstar portrayed a gay, or lesbian,
   character was during the early 2000s, when Chuck Palumbo and Billy Gunn
   teased a relationship. That was also in the TV-14 era of WWE
   programming.

   It is 2015, and the WWE has been [141]public about a good relationship
   with the “NOH8″ campaign that went viral last year. Many big names
   within WWE such as Stephanie McMahon, Triple H, Daniel Bryan, and
   Batista joined the LGBT community for equality.

   WWE is also known for supporting GLAAD on their Spirit Day by going
   all-out in purple for the cause. It’s been more prevalent since Darren
   Young, WWE superstar, [142]announced he was gay two years ago.

   The big question on everyone’s minds is how the WWE Universe will act
   upon Kalisto’s rumored gimmick. Everyone is entitled to his or her own
   opinion, and perhaps WWE will test it out at house shows first. We’ll
   keep you updated on this story as it develops.

       No
    2. Stacy Silvers [157]February 4th, 2015
       wtf no. It's offensive to gay hairstylists, luchadors and fans in
       general.
    3. [158]Ben Fuller [159]February 4th, 2015
       I think this would just be another big mistake from wwe. There
       current content is crap enough. This isn't about being gay or not
       but he has a good thing going as kalisto. If they change him he
       will likely end up like Adam rose a early to mid card jobber being
       outshone by a bunny. It be better to use Darren young in this
       gimmick. He is gay and would therefor be more beleiveable. People's
       sexuality doesn't concern me and is none of my buisness but I feel
       if they feel a need to do a gimmick like this bring in or use some
       e who is gay to play the gimmick. Kalistos career is at stake here.
       These early months in the main roster career make or break them as
       either the next beak it superstar or at once talented guy wrestler
       stuck with jobber status
    4. Pedro Gama [160]February 7th, 2015
       nope

      [23]image It’s the beginning of a new calendar year -- time for new
      expectations, contemplation and intentional examination of the past
      with the objective of developing strategic changes or improvements for
      the future.  I look forward to the constant change that comes with
      progress and hope that the New Year brings you effective data
      resolutions.   Wishing you all a 2015 filled with data success –
      assurance of data dilemmas becoming data delivered!

      In a  recent IBM white paper entitled [24]‘Meeting demands for high
      availability with advanced data protection’, research confirms, “In a
      recent survey of IT experts in both midsized and large organizations,
      49 percent said that they can’t tolerate more than 15 minutes of
      downtime for high-priority applications, while 25 percent had no
      tolerance for downtime within these critical applications. High
      availability and advanced data protection capabilities once reserved
      for financial institutions and large enterprises are now being widely
      adopted across industries and in organizations of all sizes.”

      It’s no wonder that data management and protection continues to grow in
      importance for all businesses and organizations regardless of size or
      the scale of data generated.  As the new year begins, it affords the
      opportunity to examine whether the right data decisions are in place
      and whether those decisions position you to welcome the new year with
      confidence.  To help with this data dilemma and ensure high
      availability and data protection, here are five data tips all IT people
      should ponder:

      Tip #1: Consider embracing hybrid cloud with more alacrity

      At the cost of repeating myself, enterprises who are not quick to adopt
      hybrid cloud run the risk of being left behind by competition or
      becoming obsolete.  Hybrid cloud is an extremely agile and convenient
      means to gain business agility.  Creating a private cloud can help you
      consolidate various business unit workloads as well as enable cost
      savings by allowing the private cloud to be sized to the average
      workload; thus, hybrid cloud makes it the right business and data mix.
       Plan your data distribution well and hybrid cloud may be the perfect
      solution for your data protection for the future.

      I invite you to join the upcoming January 21 news cast “[25]Eliminate
      the Barriers to Your Cloud Adoption”.  Where I sit and have a candid
      discussion with a tier-one storage analyst from IDC, a leading Business
      Partner – CAS Severn, and current client (Loyola) to go deeper into the
      hybrid cloud topic.

      [26]image
      Tip #2: Ensure your data protection solution is an analytics-based
      solution

      As per Gartner, “Analytics will take center stage as the volume of data
      generated by embedded systems increases and vast pools of structured
      and unstructured data inside and outside the enterprise are analyzed.
      Organizations need to manage how best to filter the huge amounts of
      data coming from various sources and then deliver exactly the right
      information to the right person, at the right time. Analytics will
      become deeply, but invisibly embedded everywhere.”

      Storage analytics are increasingly essential to plan and optimize
      today’s complex storage operational environments.  Growing
      organizations must quickly identify bottlenecks and find innovative
      ways to maximize and optimize capacity.  Storage analytics helps you:
       1. Resolve typical cost issues and complexity of deploying storage
          management infrastructure
       2. The inability to predict future data/storage capacity needs
       3. Improve visibility into performance bottlenecks

      Hence, it is important to ensure your data protection solution has
      in-built storage analytics to avoid wrestling with all these issues.
      Tip #3: Storage virtualization with built in management benefits all
      greatly

      Storage virtualization is a continuing and critical requirement.  As
      we’re all aware, its benefits are many time over: improved utilization,
      resiliency, flexibility, responsiveness, workload mobility and disaster
      recovery.  I encourage all my clients to adopt more storage
      virtualization.  I have discovered that the deployments of storage
      virtualization are following the same trends that compute
      virtualization did nearly a decade ago.  Once a client deploys
      virtualization, they immediately want to manage that new environment
      and start to look for technologies to do that.  So, instead of forcing
      clients to go through that double pain, clients should look for
      solutions that not only virtualize their storage environment, but
      manage it and protects the data as well….all in one solution!

      Tip #4: Policy based automation

      Improve your data management and availability through policy-based
      automation.  Automation increases efficiency significantly since it is
      (should be) based on analytics driven data.  Ensure that you replace
      your manual processes with policy-driven decisions and you’ll be on
      your way to establishing a more streamlined, efficient and stress-free
      data movement, management, and protection system for your organization.

      Tip #5: Consider abstracting embedded functionality out of hardware and
      into software-based solutions

      This is important too as it establishes a starting point for
      software-defined environments but doesn’t change much of the
      functionality.  Abstracting functionality into software-based solutions
      ensures more ease-of-use, flexible deployment models, vendor
      portability, and an easy on-ramp for hybrid cloud deployments.

      It is my recommendation that each business take a good look at where
      they stand against these five areas.  Then determine what to focus on
      and address first to get ahead or ignore and be left behind.  Data is
      the new natural resource and it’s continued growth is here to stay.
      Until next time...keep your data secure, agile, and available.

      Welcome to “The Social Business Frontier,” a video blog series
      consisting of a number of short interviews taking a deeper look inside
      the IBM Research Labs to explore the groundbreaking and innovative
      social analytics research that's redefining the future of social
      business.

      In this episode, Marie Wallace, IBM Analytics Strategist, shares the
      insights from her team’s recent effort, “Project Breadcrumbs.” It’s
      Marie’s mission to develop a solution that demonstrates how analytics
      can deliver value to each employee within an enterprise. Learn how
      Project Breadcrumbs allows our digital data (i.e., breadcrumbs) to be
      analyzed, which helps answer important questions about how the business
      works.

Berlin Muslim preacher Says Women Should not Refuse Having Sex with Their

   Berlin Muslim preacher Says Women Should not Refuse Having Sex with
   Their Husbands

   Rabat – A Berlin Muslim preacher has reportedly proclaimed that women
   “should be confined to their husband’s home” and never refuse to sleep
   with their husbands.

   In a YouTube video whose content has been reported by the Deutshe Welle
   and other German local media, Sheikh Abdel Moez al-Eila, a Berlin-based
   Imam known for his extemist preaching, called for the submission of
   women to their husbands and that a woman is not allowed to refuse
   sleeping with her husband under any excuses or pretexts.

   The sermon was originally held on January 23 at al-Nur mosque in the
   NeuKolln district of the German capital, according to the Deutshe Welle
   (DW).

   Sheikh Abdel Moez al-Eila said that a woman has the responsibility of
   “turning the home into a flourishing garden for her husband, so that he
   does not flee from her like one flees a leper of a lion.”

   He also said that a woman “should confine to her husband’s home and
   neihter leave the house, let anyone into the house, nor sleep outside
   the house without her husband’s permission.”

   The Imam added that when a man is ‘aroused’ by another woman, “he
   should go home quickly and have sex with his wife and Allah will
   immediately remove the urge from his heart.”

   “There is nothing to prevent her husband from using her body for
   pleasure,” Sheikh Abdel Moez al-Eila said, adding that even when a
   woman is mensturating she is not allowed to make excuses.

   Abdel Moez al-Eila will reportedly hold sermons in the al-Nur mosque in
   Berlin until the end of the month.
