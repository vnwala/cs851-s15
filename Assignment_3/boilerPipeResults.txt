There’s finally some word on when Android One smartphones will be getting the Lollipop update. Google India just tweeted that the new version of Android will be coming to Android One devices in the ‘next few weeks’.
The Lollipop update for the Android One phones has been awaited for a long time now. Google’s Sunder Pichai had announced at the launch that these phones will be among the first devices to get the new OS.
Android One users in India — you’ll be getting the Lollipop update in the next few weeks. @androidone
The Android One phones currently include the Micromax Canvas A1, Karbonn Sparkle V5 and Spice Dream Uno. Google had also announced that nine more companies would be joining the fray in the future, although none of them have yet announced an Android One device.
Android One is an initiative by Google to provide value for money smartphones at a low price. The devices though don’t seem to be up to the task right now, because of their mediocre specifications and the lack of marketing initiatives by Google.
Fast Android updates though could raise the value of these phones significantly, since not many phones in the budget range get the update soon. In fact, except the Motorola Moto E and Xiaomi Redmi 1S, Lollipop is not expected in any other smartphones priced under 10k anytime soon.

'Big Hero 6' Further Merges Disney With Marvel
Since the Disney-Marvel Union began, people have wondered if Disney was going to make their own adaptation of a Marvel property. Turns out, "their own adaptation" is rather different to the original.
After Disney bought Marvel, bringing the Avengers in-house, it didn't take long before producers started going through Marvel's extensive library of comic books in search of a property to develop into an animated adventure. 'Big Hero 6' is the first Disney-Marvel animation project. Although critics have wondered just how much Marvel is left in the movie.
Hiro and Baymax were redesigned to be more 'Disney friendly'
First published in 1998, 'Big Hero 6' was created by Steven T. Seagle and Duncan Rouleau in their spare time while they worked on another project. It's about a group of politicians and business owners who recruit and train a team of agents with superhuman powers for the Japanese government.
Anyone who has seen the movie will immediately recognise that this is not the film's plot. Relocated to a Japanese-flavoured America, the movie features a group of young computer nerds who create the technology they need to take on a marauding villain, in the process becoming a team of six heroes. The most fundamental difference is the central character Hiro, who in the comic book is 13 when he creates the scaly green Baymax himself using downloaded memories from his father. In the film Baymax is a cuddly pillow-shaped robot created by the dead brother of the 15-year-old Hiro.
In other words, Disney merely took the title and character names and then created a Disney movie that bears little resemblance to the relatively unknown original Marvel comics. On the plus side, this means that the books retain their integrity for fans who have yet to discover them. On the other hand, it means we'll probably never see an actual 'Big Hero 6' movie. But Disney is so adept at making entertaining movies that no one is likely to complain.
Add Luxury to Your Bathroom with Towel Warmers from WarmlyYours-Giveaway
Living in a house that requires quite a bit of fixing up means that I really notice the difference adding a new appliance or fixture can make to the comfort level of my house. Whether it’s something major like new flooring in the living room or something minor like a handy kitchen gadget, simple additions to our home don’t just improve the look, they help to make everyday life feel almost like a vacation.
That’s exactly the experience I had recently when I got the chance to review the Barcelona Towel Warmer from WarmlyYours. I have to admit that as much as I’ve sometimes coveted a towel warmer, I likely wouldn’t have ever gone out and bought one. Not only can they be quite pricey, but they also take up extra space and our tiny bathroom just doesn’t have a whole lot of that to spare.
That’s why the Barcelona Towel Warmer was such a perfect choice for me. The freestanding rack-style warmer is nice and thin, making it perfect even for our small bathroom. It also works as storage for towels since I can have about four hanging on the rack at all times. But the real luxury happens when I turn it on with a simple flick of a switch just before entering the shower. When I hop out, the towels I use to dry myself off are so warm and cozy it’s like they were just pulled out of the dryer.
This towel warmer is inexpensively priced at just $300 and adds undeniable luxury to my house. Even better, I’ve also found other uses for the towel warmer. We’ve been enjoying unusually mild weather this winter, but the downside is that warmer temperatures often mean my boys come home with their winter gear completely soaked from playing outside with friends. The Barcelona has been the ideal solution for quickly and thoroughly drying wet mittens, scarves and ski pants. And because it’s a freestanding device, I can even move it into the living room during wet weather so that it’s easily accessible for hanging up winter gear.
WarmlyYours wants to help you add extra comfort and luxury to your home too, so the company is very generously offering one lucky Mommy Kat and Kids reader their own Barcelona Towel Warmer, a $300 value! To enter to win, just leave a blog comment about your favourite feature of this towel warmer.
Since our house is over 100 years old, it has a few issues with improper insulation, something that causes it to be a little chilly in the winter. I used to almost dread getting out of the nice warm shower and ending up cold and shivering, but now that I can wrap myself up in a toasty warm towel I don’t mind at all. It’s a little thing that makes a big difference! Check out the collection of towel warmers available at WarmlyYours and see which one might be best for your house. You’ll love the luxury it adds to your bathroom!

Classics don’t become classics overnight. That distinction is earned over time. Whether it’s a striking silhouette or a popular color scheme, it takes years—and sometimes, longer—to earn the love of the community. The latest Air Max 1 unites two classics—the Air Max 1 and black-and-red colorway—to create a fresh expression of modern sport style.
Once constructed in mesh and suede for maximum performance, the Air Max 1 is now equipped for everyday life with a premium leather upper. Its premium upper arrives in the familiar combination of black and red, displayed in the same color blocking utilized by that unforgettable model introduced in 1985. A final nod to 1985—the year black-and-red footwear made its way to the court—is included with an embossed Nike Air logo on the lateral heel.
You never forget your first love. The new Air Max 1 arrives February 9 on nike.com/sportswear and at select retailers.
The fight for the soul of the Internet took a major turn Wednesday, as Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler's aggressive plan to keep the Internet open and neutral encountered enthusiastic support and threats of legal challenges.
After Wheeler outlined his plan to apply decades-old rules to label Internet service providers as public utilities, broadband Internet providers and their supporters quickly labeled it as unnecessary regulation that would stifle innovation. They vowed to thwart the plan via lawsuits and other tactics.
His backers — a diverse group ranging from Netflix and Google to an array of consumer groups — expressed their staunch approval in e-mails, comments and posts on Facebook and Twitter, reflecting the passion that net neutrality stirs among many.
The FCC is scheduled to vote on the proposal, which would prohibit content providers from paying for faster service, on Feb. 26. The plan will be circulated to the other FCC commissioners on Thursday.
It was an inauspicious day for the broadband industry, but not a surprising one. That Wheeler wants to apply the Title II authority for new net neutrality rules — named after the Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 — has been widely anticipated by industry watchers in recent weeks.
President Obama said late last year that he favored the Title II option. Wheeler also indicated that he was leaning toward the approach at the CES trade show in Las Vegas last month. The FCC's previous net neutrality rules were tossed out by a federal court last year.
Wheeler's proposal would mostly ban content providers from paying cable Internet companies, phone companies and wireless carriers to buy faster Internet "lanes" for their material, a practice known as "paid prioritization." ISPs also specifically will be prohibited from blocking or deliberately slowing access to legal content.
"Using (the Title II) authority, I am submitting to my colleagues the strongest open internet protections ever proposed by the FCC," Wheeler wrote in a story posted Wednesday on Wired.com. "These enforceable, bright-line rules will ban paid prioritization, and the blocking and throttling of lawful content and services. I propose to fully apply — for the first time ever — those bright-line rules to mobile broadband."
"My proposal assures the rights of internet users to go where they want, when they want, and the rights of innovators to introduce new products without asking anyone's permission," he wrote.
Wheeler's proposal will refrain from adopting some Title II provisions that don't apply to ISPs. To encourage Internet providers to invest, Wheeler also said he'll "modernize" Title II and "tailor it for the 21st century."
The FCC will not regulate pricing and will impose no tariffs or rules that would require unbundling of services for consumers, he said. ISPs also will be allowed to conduct engineering work related to "reasonable network management."
Some data services that don't go over the public Internet — such as voice-over-Internet phones and heart-monitoring services — will not be subject to the rules.
"Today: a big day for the high speed Internet access story in America," tweeted Susan Crawford, a noted net neutrality proponent and author of Captive Audience: The Telecom Industry and Monopoly Power in the New Gilded Age.
Wheeler's proposal is hardly the last chapter of the net neutrality debate. Several lawmakers in Congress have introduced legislation that would regulate the Internet without treating ISPs as public utilities.
Anticipating the announcement, Hank Hultquist, AT&T vice president for federal regulatory, indicated in a blog Monday that legal challenges are sure to follow. "Those who oppose efforts at compromise because they assume Title II rests on bulletproof legal theories are only deceiving themselves," he wrote.
The draft legislation, mostly supported by Republicans, should be sufficient, Glover argued. Wheeler's approach "is unnecessary because all participants in the Internet ecosystem support an open Internet," he said. "It is counterproductive because heavy regulation of the Internet will create uncertainty and chill investment among the many players."
ISPs have long dreaded the application of Title II, which has more than 100 pages of text outlining do's and don'ts and would give the FCC immense regulatory power.
Title II allows the FCC to obligate ISPs to open their back-end networks to content providers and third-party content-delivery companies, they say. It could also require ISPs to sell portions of their networks to resellers and require them to file reams of documents on their service, they said.
But proponents say stringent rules are needed, because the cable industry is poised for consolidation and many consumers contend with local monopolies in broadband Internet service. Without specific rules, ISPs would be tempted to ban, slow down or seek payment from content providers that compete with a company that has an affiliation or is owned by the Internet provider, they argue. For example, Comcast, which is trying to buy Time Warner Cable, also owns NBC Universal, which has plans to expand streaming shows.
Since he took on the task of recasting net neutrality rules, Wheeler and the FCC have been besieged with passionate comments from both sides of the debate. The agency has received about 4 million comments, a record.
Wheeler said he also considered using another legal test — a determination of "commercial reasonableness" under Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 — that would adjudicate any net neutrality violations on a case-by-case basis. He said he'll use some provisions of Section 706, along with Title II.
"While a recent court decision seemed to draw a road map for using this approach, I became concerned that this relatively new concept might, down the road, be interpreted to mean what is reasonable for commercial interests, not consumers," Wheeler wrote Wednesday.
Officials at the FCC were mulling over legal implications of several options when Obama made his announcement, which may have nudged Wheeler to move in the direction of Title II.
"Congress wisely gave the FCC the power to update its rules to keep pace with innovation," Wheeler wrote. "Under that authority my proposal includes a general conduct rule that can be used to stop new and novel threats to the internet. This means the action we take will be strong enough and flexible enough not only to deal with the realities of today, but also to establish ground rules for the as yet unimagined."

5 tips to help get the weight off :: my weight loss journey {#WWSponsored #WeightWatchers}
“This post was created as part of a relationship in which I was sponsored by Weight Watchers and given a free three month subscription to try their new Personal Coaching product and write about my experience. Though I was compensated for my time and commitment, all views, positive and negative, are my own. #WeightWatchers #WWsponsored
My weight loss has not been substantial at this point. But, that’s ok. I am not in this for quick loss and then gaining it back. I am looking for long term, healthy changes in my life…to last me the REST of my life. That being said, I wanted to share with you 5 things I have been doing to help keep me focused. Help keep me driving towards my goal. The goal I set up in my Weight Watchers account and keep watching it on a weekly basis!
I am using Weight Watchers this time around for several reasons, however, one of the biggest reasons is because it’s SO. MUCH. MORE. than just a diet program. They are humans making me feel even more like a better human. The personal coaching is uplifting me, making me feel ok when I fail, yet pushing me a little so I can pick up where I left off.
All right, enough of the mushy, mushy talk, let’s talk about some things YOU can do to achieve your weight loss success!!
Have a scheduled day to weigh in each week…same day, same time. You wouldn’t think it would make a difference, but it does when it comes to the time of day. I always do it first thing in the morning – I go to the bathroom, then grab the scale. Clockwork.
Track, track, and track some more. I don’t know about you, but if I know that I’m going to have to write something down, if it’s going to be solidified in black ink in a notebook or in my app, I hesitate to eat it. Might seem silly, but YOU try it! If you know that you are going to have to add a peanut butter cup to your app, and then it’s going to generate automatically the points in which you just consumed, I’m betting you will hesitate to eat it. That tip alone has saved me a TON of calories lol!! My tip…right now you can get a steal on calendars. Yes, you can get one that has a hefty price tag on it, and to each his own. But, I picked mine up in the dollar section at Target, y’all!! Boo-yah!! It’s perfect because there is space for each day, so I can put some food as well as my work-outs. It’s mainly for my work-outs to be honest, I like the Weight Watchers app to track my food.
Prep ahead. It’s hard to plan. Like REALLY hard for me. That has been my biggest challenge, and when I don’t plan and prep, I find myself grabbing snacks all day long…nothing of substance and only things that will leave me longing for more food. When I DO plan ahead, I have healthy snacks and meals all set and ready to roll. I have been trying to do this on the weekend, when my husband is around to help monitor the children and make sure they are staying safe lol! My advice for you is to do it when you can stay focused. I like to sit down at the computer and check out the meal section of the Weight Watchers site. The meals are FABULOUS and give huge direction. Not every one of them is up my alley, but I’m able to sort and pick from difficult to create to easy. I opt for easy 9 times out of 10.
Have a great support system. Whether it’s your spouse or significant other or a family member or a friend. Having someone you can talk to about things whenever you need to, is HUGELY important! If you don’t have a good support system, that is where I find the PERSONAL COACHING is beyond fabulous. I have stuck with the same gal, and I love it. You can totally switch it up, but the gal I picked meshes well with me. They have a little bio when you are reading about the personal coaches. I picked one that was in to running, because when I do workout, the food is what gets me. I want to eat everything in sight! I needed someone that understood this. Outside of my husband, she is my other part of the support system. She lifts me up and points things out that I may have not see. Crucial!! Oh yes…one more thing. Sorry, I keep adding, but this is a great point too! There is 24/7 help via the Weight Watchers app and online too! Just one click and you are on your way to the help or reassurance you need!
The last thing, just have more good days than bad days. Period. Don’t beat yourself up. Work on loving yourself!! Tomorrow is a new day! Make better choices tomorrow and you will feel good!!
So, talk to me. What are your biggest tips? Or…what are your biggest struggles? How are YOU getting healthy this year? I’d love to chat about this!!

Bearhawk Patrols Debut in Africa and Brazil
AUSTIN, TEXAS, FEBRUARY 4, 2015 - Bearhawk Aircraft announced today two firsts for its Bearhawk Patrol aircraft kits: 1) The first flight of a completed Bearhawk Patrol in South Africa, and 2) The first shipment of a Bearhawk Patrol kit to Brazil. The Bearhawk Patrol, available as a Quick-Build kit, is a two-place tandem seated aircraft resembling the Piper Super Cub. It differs notably by its single-strut-braced wings and an advanced airfoil. These developments come shortly after the company publicly debuted its new Bearhawk LSA, a slightly smaller design that meets Sport Pilot requirements.
The first Bearhawk Patrol, ZU-HUB, to fly in South Africa has now logged 27+ hours. Owned by South African Bearhawk distributor, Wayne Giles, ZU-HUB is turning heads in the region. Giles is reporting a fast cruise of 155 mph indicated at 75-percent power. The Patrol has a Superior IO-360 engine that develops 180 hp while swinging a three-bladed composite propeller from MT-Propeller.
Mark Goldberg, president of Bearhawk Aircraft, commented, "What is surprising the aviation community of South Africa is the Patrol's fast cruise speed while still being able to land and takeoff as short as a PA-18 Super Cub." The Patrol's speed is attributed to the Riblett 30-413.5 airfoil design and flush riveted wings. Commending Giles on his completion of the aircraft, Mark added, "Beautiful job Wayne!"
Giles' son (a film major) produced a video of the aircraft's first flight; it can be viewed at http://youtu.be/Ftj8foKVR2M. Photos of the first Bearhawk Patrol in Africa included one of the finished aircraft and Giles' "esteemed helper Mattheus." Wayne added he is "very pleased with the outcome and end result of the aeroplane we built together!" The South African Patrol was completed in two years, following delivery of the kit.
Meanwhile across the Atlantic, the first Bearhawk Patrol Quick-Build kit was shipped to a customer in Brazil. A rancher from Santa Catarina province in southern Brazil, Fernando Frahm took a demo flight at AirVenture Oshkosh 2014, whereupon he decided to purchase the Patrol. Frahm knew it was the airplane he needed to land at the short strip on his ranch. It would also allow him greater travel flexibility at better cruise speeds than similar STOL/utility aircraft he had been considering.
The Brazilian customer requested that the majority of items to complete his Quick-Build kit be packed in the shipping container. This is a common occurrence with overseas deliveries. Sourcing parts is more easily done is the U.S., and Bearhawk Aircraft is able to simplify shipping, customs and other considerations on behalf of its customers. For example, in late 2014, the company held a shipment while waiting for PolyFiber fabric covering supplies and Grove wheels/brakes to arrive. Goldberg commented, "We are always willing to help them out." Bearhawk aircraft kits have been exported to many countries around the globe, including: Canada, Ecuador, Brazil, Germany, Norway, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.
Bearhawk Aircraft manufactures high-quality Quick-Build aircraft kits for the Bearhawk 4-Place, and two-place tandem Bearhawk Patrol and Bearhawk LSA. Designed by engineer Bob Barrows, the Bearhawks have in common excellent performance and superb flying characteristics. Bearhawks are known for their short field capability, higher than expected cruise speeds, and very gentle slow speed manners. For utility and recreational use, Bearhawk aircraft are flown by customers around the world.
Berlin Muslim preacher Says Women Should not Refuse Having Sex with Their Husbands
Rabat – A Berlin Muslim preacher has reportedly proclaimed that women “should be confined to their husband’s home” and never refuse to sleep with their husbands.
In a YouTube video whose content has been reported by the Deutshe Welle and other German local media, Sheikh Abdel Moez al-Eila, a Berlin-based Imam known for his extemist preaching, called for the submission of women to their husbands and that a woman is not allowed to refuse sleeping with her husband under any excuses or pretexts.
The sermon was originally held on January 23 at al-Nur mosque in the NeuKolln district of the German capital, according to the Deutshe Welle (DW).
Sheikh Abdel Moez al-Eila said that a woman has the responsibility of “turning the home into a flourishing garden for her husband, so that he does not flee from her like one flees a leper of a lion.”
He also said that a woman “should confine to her husband’s home and neihter leave the house, let anyone into the house, nor sleep outside the house without her husband’s permission.”
The Imam added that when a man is ‘aroused’ by another woman, “he should go home quickly and have sex with his wife and Allah will immediately remove the urge from his heart.”
“There is nothing to prevent her husband from using her body for pleasure,” Sheikh Abdel Moez al-Eila said, adding that even when a woman is mensturating she is not allowed to make excuses.
Abdel Moez al-Eila will reportedly hold sermons in the al-Nur mosque in Berlin until the end of the month.

The telecom giant is working hard to make business collaboration easier. AT&T’s latest effort toward that goal is the launch of AT&T UC Federation, a cloud-based service that allows suppliers, partners and customers to communicate in real-time across various networks.
AT&T UC Federation is working to overcome a real challenge for enterprises that demand dependable collaboration. Disparate unified communication (UC) systems have made seamless collaboration difficult at best and at times problematic. AT&T is working to tackle these challenges by making it possible for internal and external teams to collaborate freely across supported UC platforms.
"Companies that try to set up UC platforms on their own can face challenges when creating scalable, secure connectivity that meets compliance and support requirements," said Vishy Gopalakrishnan, AVP Big Data and Advanced Solutions at AT&T Business Solutions. "UC Federation from AT&T provides tools to help overcome this challenge by removing the hassle and allowing business teams to connect easily and over a highly securely platform."
Avoiding UC Hiccups
Created in AT&T Labs, AT&T UC Federation supports a number of UC platforms, including Microsoft Lync and Cisco Jabber. The technology also promises to give organizations the flexibility and security to connect to any supported UC platforms where partners, suppliers and vendors are doing business.
AT&T UC Federation also lets enterprises control which organizations can communicate at the company, group or user level and even allows certain communication methods, like instant messaging, and blocks others, such as online presence. The idea is to let enterprises share as much or as little information as they choose.
AT&T is also promising direct benefits to businesses that are merging or creating joint ventures with other businesses. That’s because the platform gives customers the flexibility to grow and coexist without being limited to a single UC platform. It also helps support collaboration without any hiccups when a company switches to a new communications platform.
Just the Beginning
Some enterprises are already testing the platform. Sonus, a company that offers secure real-time communications, has deployed and tested AT&T UC Federation. The company is in the midst of a full-service rollout.
"With AT&T UC Federation, our sales team can connect with key contacts on the spot, in less time than an e-mail would take," said Michael Swade, senior vice president of Worldwide Sales and Marketing, Sonus. "It makes collaboration easy, and it truly functions as if each user is communicating on the same platform. We can IM and check presence all within a secure connection."
This is just the beginning for the AT&T UC Federation. The company plans to extend the platform beyond IM and presence to include calendar integration as well as video and voice capabilities later in 2015. AT&T also hinted that more UC platforms may also be supported in the future. The company is offering a free 90-day trial for UC Federation for up to 25 users.

Book Description
Beaten once again and left for dead by the man she should have been able to trust with her life, Kate awakened from a coma to discover that not only has she lost the precious baby she carried, the beating also damaged her internally so that doctors didn't think she would ever conceive again. As if that weren't enough, Kate is also nearly blind due to the injury to her brain.
Scarred--not only physically, but emotionally and spiritually too--Kate moves in with her childhood friend to try to recover. Eventually her physical body begins to heal, but her emotional state seems to deteriorate with each passing day. It isn't until Patricia Daniels, an Irish psychotherapist, comes into her life that Kate finally starts putting the pieces back together in her shattered life.
Patricia (Trish to her friends) takes Kate with her on holiday to Ireland and Scotland. Through a series of kindhearted Celtic men, brick by brick Kate is finally able to bring down the fortress she's built around herself. The only question is whether a shattered shell of a woman can love wholeheartedly.
Heart Shaped Shards is not only an endearing romance, it is a story of triumph; a testimony to the perseverance of the human spirit. This novel deals with the difficult subject of spousal abuse, but leaves the reader with the knowledge that there is always hope...and when there's hope, amazing things can happen.
"I had a love/hate relationship with this book. I absolutely LOVED the story, but the details of Kate's abuse opened up the closet to my own past. I am actually now in therapy because of it! I have Ms. MacAlister to thank for shoving me down the road to recovery :) "
With her powerful new novel, Ria MacAlister is turning the tables with a hard-hitting depiction of the "woman next door."
"Heart Shaped Shards" replaces swept-back billionaires and doting brides with the possibility that two souls who have been beaten down by the world may one day find each other.

Editorial Reviews
From the Author
Hello Dear Reader,
I wanted to share a little bit about what 'Heart Shaped Shards' meant to me when I was writing the story. I hope you won't mind a bit of self-indulgence.
In 2010, I was hurting. I was in my fifth marriage, but felt very much alone. My husband was actually a great guy and not the abusers I had been unfortunate to be married to in the past, but he was emotionally absent. I don't blame him. I probably added fuel to the fire with my tendency to retreat into a protective shell.
Oh, on the outside I was fine. Held it together pretty well, even to those closest to me. But on the inside, the place where those closet skeletons like to sneak out and torment you, I was a wreck. There was no way I was going to seek counseling...that was for crazy people, right? Well, I didn't want to admit to that, although I'm sure I would have greatly benefited from a few hundred go-rounds with a psychologist.
Instead, I did a bit of soul-searching and decided what I needed most--the one thing I had never had--was a caring, loving, protective man. Certain such a creature didn't truly exist, I tried to find him in books.
What I found instead were a lot of great stories that were so far from true life that it really sunk me further into a funk. Oh, there were a few heroes who came very close to what I needed (Arion of 'Shadow Fires' from Catherine Spangler's amazing Shielder Series quicklycomes to mind), but none who were very believable for an everyday, real-life man (Arion lived on another planet in a galaxy far, far away, for Pete's sake!). So, I decided to write "my man."
I won't spoil the story by giving you too many details, but I do want to say that, after writing the book and going through the inevitable divorce, I actually MET "my man"!! I am now married to the alpha male hero of my dreams, and we couldn't be happier!
So, as I like to say, happy endings do happen...you just have to wait for them.
Much love,
Ria
About the Author
Ria MacAlister has not lived a fairy-tale life. Molested as a child, raped as a teen and abused as a wife, she buried herself in books and relationships to help numb self-deprecating feelings. When her fifth marriage started heading south, she began writing as a panacea of sorts to help heal her own scars, completing her first novel in just seven months.Ria lives in the southwestern United States with her sixth (and she swears last!) husband, who happens to closely resemble the hero of 'Heart Shaped Shards'. Ria says she met her husband after she wrote the novel, knowing right away this marriage was meant to be. They're currently pursuing their happily ever after.
I loved this book! The story line was a little dark at first, but it was a great read on the whole. I do have to say that while I loved the entire story, I really found it unbelievable that so many masculine men would cry as they do. That's all I found a little off with this novel. The rest was just fantastic. Great work.
One of the best things about novels like this is that they take a very sensitive subject and bring it to the forefront allowing for discussion on the topic. Even though a great deal of individuals would like to ignore or even deny its existence, spousal abuse does exist. MacAlister takes the subject and creates an amazingly realistic and very gripping story from it.
I loved the fact that this was not your stereotypical romance novel. Yes, it had the elements. Girl falls for boy. Boy falls for girl. They live life happily ever after. But this novel was so much more. The characters had real issues to overcome and they were not 20 year olds from the highest strata of society.
MacAlister's writing is clear, concise and to the point while still full of detail that breathes life into the story. Her writing is not overly flowery, powder puff writing. She creates such realistic scenes that you feel like you are there, feeling pain and/or joy with the characters. She is also able to make that unmistakable feeling of the unreality of a situation come to life on the pages.
The characters in this novel are also phenomenal. MacAlister has nailed the actual aggressor, victim, and alpha male (swoon) behaviours and responses, rather than relying on cultural stereotypes. I am very impressed that she took the extra time for this. In my opinion, this increases not only the reliability of the novel, but also the enjoyment level for the reader.
As much as the plight of the protagonist is heart wrenching, I definitely laughed my butt off more than once while reading this novel. MacAlister manages to evoke the entire emotional spectra in her readers throughout the novel. By the end of the novel I was simultaneously in love (with Shay), in lust (with Patrick), and in hate (with Tony). It was absolutely brilliant.
I saw a link for this book on a social network site and decided to download it. I found myself laughing & crying many times throughout the book. Ms. MacAlisiter most certainly has a knack for drawing the reader in & keeping their interest.
I was so captivated by the whole story!!! Her character development is simply amazing. I felt like I knew everyone in the book & could picture how they looked and what their voices would actually sound like. I love romance stories and this one blew me away.
It wasn't your typical sappy "all's right with the world & they lived happily ever after" story. There were amazing "never saw that coming" moments that really kept me interested. I can't wait for the next story!!!!
I want to start by saying Ria MacAlister did a great job in writing this book. I loved it from the beginning to the end. It was an extremely well written book. I felt all of Katie's pain and fears like they were my own. I got lost in this book. Ria made the charcters seem like they were real. This wonderful book had me on an emoitional rollercoaster, but in a good way. I would recommend this book. I really can't wait for the next book.
I don’t normally read love stories but this book captivated me.Horrible husband-battered wife relationship.The emotionally scarred wife, Kate, picks up the pieces and …….Hey! I’m not going to reveal further. Read the book!Ria, good job! Looking forward to more from you.
Heartshaped Shards is a tough read in the beginning. Kate Kincaid is in a horrible relationship and her husband is a monster in my opinion. One night he beats her and leaves her for dead. She doesn't die, but she's emotionally and physically scarred.
Luckily for Kate she has two incredible friends to help her through it. During a trip to Ireland and Scotland she discovers something about herself. I won't say too much more since I don't want to ruin the story.
This story is an emotional roller coaster. At times I was laughing and then I would plunge into sadness. Kate is the type of character that readers cheer for. She's vulnerable, but determined, witty, but also clueless, and quite lovable. It you enjoy stories about the power of love don't miss this one.
Without a doubt Ria MacAlister brings to the forefront the horrific abuse that goes on between spouses and partners. The story was riveting and the reader is more than satisfied with the ending when the victim becomes the victor. I couldn't put the book down until I knew things were going to be all right again.

When her fifth marriage started heading south, she began writing as a panacea of sorts to help heal her own scars, completing her first novel, 'Heartshaped Shards' in just seven months. Never seriously intending to publish her novel, friends and family insisted she do so after reading the story. One friend encouraged, "It has to be shared! I think it could really help someone else. If just one person is helped, then it's worth it, isn't it?" So, Ria took a leap of faith and put her story into the public's hands.
Ria lives in the southwestern United States with her sixth (and she swears last!) husband, who happens to closely resemble the hero of 'Heartshaped Shards'.

It’s the beginning of a new calendar year -- time for new expectations, contemplation and intentional examination of the past with the objective of developing strategic changes or improvements for the future. I look forward to the constant change that comes with progress and hope that the New Year brings you effective data resolutions. Wishing you all a 2015 filled with data success – assurance of data dilemmas becoming data delivered!
In a recent IBM white paper entitled ‘Meeting demands for high availability with advanced data protection’, research confirms, “In a recent survey of IT experts in both midsized and large organizations, 49 percent said that they can’t tolerate more than 15 minutes of downtime for high-priority applications, while 25 percent had no tolerance for downtime within these critical applications. High availability and advanced data protection capabilities once reserved for financial institutions and large enterprises are now being widely adopted across industries and in organizations of all sizes.”
It’s no wonder that data management and protection continues to grow in importance for all businesses and organizations regardless of size or the scale of data generated. As the new year begins, it affords the opportunity to examine whether the right data decisions are in place and whether those decisions position you to welcome the new year with confidence. To help with this data dilemma and ensure high availability and data protection, here are five data tips all IT people should ponder:
Tip #1: Consider embracing hybrid cloud with more alacrity
At the cost of repeating myself, enterprises who are not quick to adopt hybrid cloud run the risk of being left behind by competition or becoming obsolete. Hybrid cloud is an extremely agile and convenient means to gain business agility. Creating a private cloud can help you consolidate various business unit workloads as well as enable cost savings by allowing the private cloud to be sized to the average workload; thus, hybrid cloud makes it the right business and data mix. Plan your data distribution well and hybrid cloud may be the perfect solution for your data protection for the future.
I invite you to join the upcoming January 21 news cast “Eliminate the Barriers to Your Cloud Adoption”. Where I sit and have a candid discussion with a tier-one storage analyst from IDC, a leading Business Partner – CAS Severn, and current client (Loyola) to go deeper into the hybrid cloud topic.
As per Gartner, “Analytics will take center stage as the volume of data generated by embedded systems increases and vast pools of structured and unstructured data inside and outside the enterprise are analyzed. Organizations need to manage how best to filter the huge amounts of data coming from various sources and then deliver exactly the right information to the right person, at the right time. Analytics will become deeply, but invisibly embedded everywhere.”
Hence, it is important to ensure your data protection solution has in-built storage analytics to avoid wrestling with all these issues.
Tip #3: Storage virtualization with built in management benefits all greatly
Storage virtualization is a continuing and critical requirement. As we’re all aware, its benefits are many time over: improved utilization, resiliency, flexibility, responsiveness, workload mobility and disaster recovery. I encourage all my clients to adopt more storage virtualization. I have discovered that the deployments of storage virtualization are following the same trends that compute virtualization did nearly a decade ago. Once a client deploys virtualization, they immediately want to manage that new environment and start to look for technologies to do that. So, instead of forcing clients to go through that double pain, clients should look for solutions that not only virtualize their storage environment, but manage it and protects the data as well….all in one solution!
Tip #4: Policy based automation
Improve your data management and availability through policy-based automation. Automation increases efficiency significantly since it is (should be) based on analytics driven data. Ensure that you replace your manual processes with policy-driven decisions and you’ll be on your way to establishing a more streamlined, efficient and stress-free data movement, management, and protection system for your organization.
Tip #5: Consider abstracting embedded functionality out of hardware and into software-based solutions
This is important too as it establishes a starting point for software-defined environments but doesn’t change much of the functionality. Abstracting functionality into software-based solutions ensures more ease-of-use, flexible deployment models, vendor portability, and an easy on-ramp for hybrid cloud deployments.
It is my recommendation that each business take a good look at where they stand against these five areas. Then determine what to focus on and address first to get ahead or ignore and be left behind. Data is the new natural resource and it’s continued growth is here to stay. Until next time...keep your data secure, agile, and available.

Tokyo, the world’s most populous metropolitan area, took the prize for safest overall city, and also won for best digital security. Zurich was tops in both health and infrastructure, and Singapore in personal security.
Across all the EIU’s indexes, which include “liveability,” “cost of living,” “food security” and more, the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world is…
Toronto.
Here’s the grain of salt. You’ll probably notice that some cities dubbed the most liveable are missing from the list of safe cities. Where’s Vancouver? Vienna? The report doesn’t make fully clear why many cities that top EIU’s Global Liveability Index fail to show up on the Safety Index.
Here are the top 10 safest cities, according to EIU. All photos from nighttime because it’s super safe!

13 of "Girls'" most cringeworthy sex scenes
Hannah and Adam, "Pilot"
One of our first exposures to uncomfortable “Girls” sex comes early, in the pilot episode, when Hannah and Adam “get feisty” (a phrase Hannah hates) on the couch. The pair is about to go at it doggy-style when Adam nearly inserts his penis in “the wrong hole,” and after Hannah corrects him, she awkwardly explains her lack of desire to have anal sex in too many words. “Hey, let’s play the quiet game,” Adam says, thrusting. And so the romance begins.

Elijah, who is trying to explore the “hetero side” of his bisexuality, can’t maintain his erection, and the entire affair ends in very uncomfortable silence.

Poor Charlie. While he and Marnie have their fair share of uncomfortable sex over the course of their relationship, one of the saddest moments (aside from Marnie breaking up with him during intercourse) is when Marnie encourages him to penetrate her from behind so she doesn’t have to look at him. “This feels so good,” Charlie says. “We have to go slow.” Poor sucker.

At least it paves the way for the uncomfortable sex we later get to watch her have with Ray?

Hannah and Adam, "Hard Being Easy"
On the heels of trying (unsuccessfully) to determine the status of her early relationship with Adam, Hannah walks by her future boyfriend’s bedroom to find him masturbating alone, in one of the strangest scenes of the first season. As Adam jerks off and refuses to let Hannah participate beyond telling him how much she likes watching, we see some serious (and odd) character development ... which ends with Hannah taking a hundred-dollar bill from Adam’s wallet, for cab fare and pizza (as well as her services).

Oh, Booth Jonathan -- the little man who “knows how to do things.” After he turns Marnie on enough to make her masturbate in the bathroom at the gallery where she works, Booth finally seals the deal in a mortifying and nearly painful to watch sex scene that tells us pretty much everything we need to know about how much Marnie is willing to fake it.

The only sex scene in the series not to feature one of the main characters, Hannah’s parents’ showertime anniversary celebration is easily one of the most cringe-worthy moments of the show’s first season. Even Hannah’s mother, Loreen, observes how embarrassing the situation is, which ends with her husband, Tad, slipping out of the shower and falling naked and unconscious on the bathroom floor.

Time to press pause.

News Release
IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Release No: NR-027-15January 29, 2015
Statement by Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel on the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission Report
On behalf of the Department of Defense, I thank the members of the independent, bipartisan Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission for their hard work over the last year and a half. They have developed a wide-ranging set of recommendations on reforming and modernizing the package of benefits we provide to America's men and women in uniform and their families, and DoD will analyze the commission's proposals in full detail. While the recommendations released today will not affect the budget request that the president will submit to Congress next week, they will inform discussions that DoD will have with Congress over the course of this year.
I appreciate that the commission gathered input from over 150,000 service members and veterans across the country before formulating its recommendations. I also appreciate the commission's support for grandfathering current servicemembers and retirees with its recommended changes on retirement pay; its focus on protecting future recruitment and retention; and its attempt to propose savings to ensure our military will be able to field a ready, agile, and modern force capable of meeting present and future threats.
At the Pentagon, in Congress, and at bases around the world, these recommendations will be the subject of much discussion and debate. They should be. And as we decide how to move forward, we have to remember the two highest and most solemn obligations this country has to its military: to ensure our troops and their families are fairly and appropriately compensated and cared for during and after their time in uniform, and to provide our troops with the best training and equipment possible -- so that whenever America calls on them, they are prepared to accomplish the mission and return home safely to their families.
Apple Boosts Size of Bond Deal to $6.5 Billion
The iPhone maker sold $6.5 billion in bonds on Monday, including a round of 30-year debt that will pay 3.5% annually. That is even lower than Apple’s $17 billion bond sale in April 2013, when a 30-year bond yielded about 3.9%.
Apple’s deal is the largest U.S. high-grade corporate-bond sale so far...
OSU lists Lucas as a receiver, a position without a commitment heading into Signing Day. Rivals rates the speedy Lucas as a the No. 9 all-purpose back in the country, making him an intriguing piece as the Beavers move toward more of a spread offense.
Lucas had originally committed to the hometown Sun Devils on Christmas. He also had offers from Arizona, Nebraska, Notre Dame, Tennessee, Utah, UCLA and Washington.
Apple Raises $6.5 Billion From Bond Sale Funding Share Buybacks
(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is showing it can keep coming back to the bond market to fund share buybacks and preserve its overseas cash hoard.
The iPhone maker sold $6.5 billion in debt Monday in a deal that was bigger than it initially intended with borrowing costs that are some of its lowest ever. The offering included 30-year debt with a 3.45 percent coupon, or 0.3 percentage point less than the record-low yield investors demanded on Friday to own similar corporate debt with comparable maturities.
Apple has now raised the equivalent of $39 billion from the bond market in less than two years, bringing the company closer to fulfilling a pledge to boost the value of its stock amid pressure from billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn. Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told analysts last week that the Cupertino, California-based company has completed $103 billion of it $130 billion capital returns plan.
“Apple has proven itself to be pretty thoughtful and shrewd when it comes to capital allocation over the last couple of years, and that hasn’t been lost on the bond market,” said Scott Kessler, a technology analyst at S&P Capital IQ in New York. “It makes sense for them to be active participants in the corporate bond market.”
Apple has been turning to bonds instead of using cash that’s mostly held overseas, which would subject it to repatriation taxes. Apple ended December with about $178 billion in cash and marketable securities, according to a company statement on Jan. 27. Of that $157.8 billion were held by foreign subsidiaries.
Investors Rewarded
Investors have been rewarded well for owning Apple bonds, which have returned 13.7 percent since the end of 2013, outperforming the 10.3 percent gain in debt of similarly rated companies, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. The extra yield investors demand to own the debt has dropped 3 basis points during the same period, even as it widened 16 basis points on average for borrowings of companies with similar ratings. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
Icahn in October renewed pressure on Apple to accelerate the stock buybacks, saying its shares are undervalued and should be at $203. That’d give Apple a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion. Apple’s shares closed at $118.63 in New York Monday.
‘Bullish Signal’
Apple increased its capital return program to $100 billion in April 2013, including share buybacks and dividends. The company raised it by $30 billion in April last year along with a boost to the dividend and split of its stock 7-for-1.
The new borrowings come after Apple posted a 30 percent jump in fiscal first quarter revenue to $74.6 billion on Jan. 27, its largest sales increase in three years. Net income rose 38 percent to a record $18 billion.
“The borrowing is a bullish signal in the confidence of their business,” said Michael Walkley, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity Inc. in Minneapolis. “A debt offering is about the sustainability of providing strong long-term cash flows, and taking advantage of attractively priced financing.”
Steve Dowling, a spokesman for Apple, didn’t respond to a telephone call and e-mail seeking comment on the offering.
The company issued the securities in five parts, including $2 billion of 30-year bonds, Bloomberg data show. The average yield on the highest-rated company bonds with maturities of at least 15 years was 3.76 percent on Jan. 31, according to Bank of America Merill Lynch Index data.
“Apple is getting attractive terms,” Mike Buchanan, the Pasadena, California-based head of global credit at Western Asset, said in a telephone interview. “The demand for high quality will continue to encourage companies to tap the market.”
Ms Viera said she had begged the Australian foreign embassy to attend the DNA test with her but was rejected because Mr Campello was travelling on a Brazilian passport.
“I am really scared because I do not trust the police here,” she said.
“I want an Australian doctor or a Brazilian doctor to come with me while I do it.”
The Brazilian national went missing from his hotel room in Gili Trawangan, one of a group of three islands east of Bali.
Balinese police were still searching after Ms Viera failed to identify the corpse.

“I was speaking to the mum yesterday and she was crying,” said an officer who would only be named as Natamoken.
“I am looking and the policemen are still looking on this island and all over Gili Islands.
“I am telling people to bring the body to Gili if they find it because the mum is here.”

Mr Campello had said he was worried about flying before heading overseas last year.
Mr Campello and his friend Andre Romano, 24, left Australia in December on an Air Asia flight just one day after AirAsia flight 8501 plummeted into the ocean killing all 162 people on board.
“No one knows what’s going on and that is the most worrying thing,” said Mr Campello at Gold Coast Airport moments before he was shuttled to his AirAsia flight to begin what was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime.
Mr Romano said at the time that they would not let fear halt their trip. They were travelling to Kuala Lumpur.
“We were very afraid when we first heard,” Mr Romano said. “We were trying not to think about it because we will be catching heaps more planes in our lives. We wouldn’t let it ruin our trip.”
Mr Campello survived the flight, but two months later his family and numerous Australian authorities are desperately searching for any sign of the missing Brazilian.
Ms Viera said her son went missing after consuming an alcoholic drink and falling sick.
She said he was last seen walking back to his hotel on Gili Trawangan.
A friend who walked back to the hotel room with Mr Campello said the young man had become paranoid and started to hear voices.
The next morning his hotel room was empty.
More concerning, Ms Viera said local authorities had refused to search nearby caves fearing “evil spirits”.
It is the second tragedy to rock the Gold Coast’s Brazilian community with the alleged tomahawk murder of pregnant Fabiana Palhares on Monday.
Classics don’t become classics overnight. That distinction is earned over time. Whether it’s a striking silhouette or a popular color scheme, it takes years—and sometimes, longer—to earn the love of the community. The latest Air Max 1 unites two classics—the Air Max 1 and black-and-red colorway—to create a fresh expression of modern sport style.
Once constructed in mesh and suede for maximum performance, the Air Max 1 is now equipped for everyday life with a premium leather upper. Its premium upper arrives in the familiar combination of black and red, displayed in the same color blocking utilized by that unforgettable model introduced in 1985. A final nod to 1985—the year black-and-red footwear made its way to the court—is included with an embossed Nike Air logo on the lateral heel.
You never forget your first love. The new Air Max 1 arrives February 9 on nike.com/sportswear and at select retailers.

Guardians of the Galaxy Blu-ray Disc (USED) Description
A group of interstellar outlaws team up to save the galaxy from a villain who seeks ultimate power in this comic book space adventure from Marvel Studios and director James Gunn (SLITHER, SUPER). Peter Quill was just a young boy when, devastated by his mother's death, he sprinted out of the hospital and was swept into the stars by Yondu (Michael Rooker), the leader of an eclectic band of space scavengers known as The Ravagers. Twenty-six years later, Quill has adopted the nickname Star Lord (Chris Pratt). He's broken away from The Ravagers in an attempt to track down an ancient orb that is also coveted by the evil Ronan (Lee Pace), who is in league with the dreaded Thanos, and who dispatches his top assassin Gamora (Zoe Saldana) to retrieve it from Star Lord. In the process of doing so, Gamora also gets drawn into a fight with furry bounty hunter Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper) and his tree-like, humanoid companion Groot (voice of Vin Diesel). Subsequently thrown into prison, this unlikely quartet quickly makes the acquaintance of fearsome warrior Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), who seeks bitter revenge for the slaughter of his entire family at the hands of Ronan. In the process of making a daring prison break, Star Lord, Gamora, Rocket, Groot, and Drax recover the orb, and transport it to The Collector (Benecio Del Toro), who reveals that it houses an Infinity Gem - one of six precious stones that harbors incredible powers that could pose a dire threat should they fall into the wrong hands. Later, Ronan acquires the Infinity Gem and plots to use its power to destroy The Nova Corps home-world of Xandar, The Guardians of the Galaxy must race through the stars to recover it before Ronan can carry out his genocidal plan.

With dropshipping, you are not buying the products upfront. So it doesn't matter the number of products that you list for sale. With the light bulk suppliers in our database, they have minimum orders of $500 or less, so you can keep your own inventory for better profit margins.
Do I have to pay for the product before I sell it?
With dropshipping no. The supplier will be sending the product on your behalf to the end customer. You will pay for the product once a customer orders from you.
Do I have to pay the supplier a membership fee too?
We do not list wholesale suppliers with membership or account setup fees.
What is a drop ship fee?
A drop ship fee is also called a “handling” fee. This is the fee to pay the wholesale supplier to split apart cases and pack one product to send to your customer.
How much is the drop ship fee?
If there is a drop ship fee, they typically range from $1.00 to $5.00. Sometimes you will see a higher drop ship fee, which is understandable once you see the type of product that will be sent. Delicate products take more to pack and ship them, so the extra cost has to be charged in the drop ship fee.
What kind of profit margins are there with dropshipping?
This all depends on the products that you source and the supplier that you work with. All wholesale suppliers have their own wholesale pricing structures, so you will have to contact the wholesale supplier that you want to work with to get those wholesale prices to see what type of profit you can make.
Sports Pulse, LLC would profit up to 20% or as low as 5%. The average being 10%.
What are middlemen?
A middleman is a company that was created to simply pass on orders. A middleman will not hold inventory and will send your order to the actual manufacturer or wholesale supplier to send the product. They charge extra fees to do this, and that is typically found in the increased "wholesale" cost.
How do I get images and descriptions of the dropshipped products for my website?
The wholesale suppliers that dropship, will provide you with all the images & product descriptions that you will need to sell the product once you have setup an account with the wholesale supplier.
Can you use a drop ship supplier and sell on eBay?
You can use dropshipping to sell on eBay. eBay is a good place to test the product market to get more instant results. It is difficult to compete on eBay, so it’s best to purchase in light bulk quantities to sell on the eBay platform. You will get even better pricing by purchasing wholesale products in this manner, and you will have the control over your shipping so there will not be an issue with feedback.
How do I know the product will still be in stock by the time I sell it?
Many wholesale suppliers have real time inventory. That means that at any given moment, you can go to the wholesale suppliers website, and they will tell you the number of items left.
Why does Dropshipping cost more?
Dropshipping wholesale prices are higher, because you are buying one product at a time. Bulk discounts occur when you can purchase the required minimum from a wholesale supplier. The more you buy, the higher the discount. This is how large chain stores like Wal-Mart, Target, Best Buy and etc are able to keep prices so low. They are buying in HUGE quantities to stock their stores Worldwide.
Why don't all suppliers offer Dropshipping?
Dropshipping takes extra time and manpower. Many wholesale suppliers are not willing to do business this way and it will increase their overhead.
Do I need a Tax ID to work with a dropshipper?
Yes of course! Legitimate wholesale suppliers will require a business tax ID in order to sell wholesale to you. This makes the products non-taxable to you, but you can tax your customers.
Do I need a Tax ID to work with dropshippers if I'm outside the US?
60%-70% of wholesale suppliers will work with international retailers. If you are interested in a specific country, and only want to work with wholesale suppliers in that country, you are welcome to do so. Keep in mind, that since International rules differ from the US, there is no tax ID involved like you would need for the USA. So you will typically not need a tax ID in order to work with US wholesale suppliers. However, you will still need to obtain a registered business name and any other documentation required to prove you are a legitimate retailer. So you will need to check with your country or region to see what you need to show you are a genuine retailer. Quick tip! In a search engine, type Starting a business in XXXX and replace the X’s with your country name. There are a lot of great free resources out there that will provide you with what you need to know.
Do I need a Tax ID to work with dropshippers if I am only planning to sell on eBay?
Yes of course! The same rule applies as above. Legitimate wholesale suppliers will require a business tax ID in order to sell wholesale to you. This makes the products non-taxable to you, but you can tax your customers.
Can I use my website as my registered business name?
Your website or online store is your store name. Business names can differ from your store name. But the important thing is to register with your state.
I have an EIN. Is this the Tax ID the suppliers want in order to work with them?
An EIN is a federal ID number. This allows you to have employees and submit taxes on those employees. Many wholesale suppliers will accept an EIN, but you also need to get a Tax ID number from your state to charge sales tax to any customer that is also located in your state.
Will the dropship supplier use my company information on the shipment to my customer?
Many of the listed wholesale suppliers will send the product in your name, or they will blind drop ship, so the customer doesn’t know exactly where it came from.
If I give my customer's information to the dropshipper, couldn't they steal my customer from me and cut me out of the sale for any future purchases?
A wholesale supplier's business is selling to retailers, not the end consumer. Some wholesale suppliers have contracts you can sign that will state they will not market to your customers.
How are returns handled? Do my customers ship the products to me or the supplier?
This will vary from wholesale supplier to supplier. Each has their own rules on returns. You will have to adhere to the wholesale suppliers policies.
What is Blind Dropshipping?
Blind dropshipping is when the wholesale supplier will use a return label that reads something like "Fulfillment Center" or "Shipper" as the business name.
How do I figure out how much to charge for shipping when using multiple dropshippers?
This can be complicated, since a customer could potentially order 2 different items from 2 different suppliers. You wouldn't want to charge your customer too much for shipping, so you can do a few things; 1. You can make sure that your suppliers use one service like UPS to ship. Then you can use the UPS calculator to get shipping costs for the 2 products from one location. Or 2. You can calculate shipping charges on each product and charge a flat fee for shipping. You will lose money on some shipping charges, but you will gain on others.
What are the benefits of using a Dropshipper for my business?
No overhead is the first benefit. You are not storing and stocking the inventory, so there are no extra costs involved there. There are no extra costs for you to take the time to pack and ship the product. Dropshipping is also great for testing the product.
Can I use several Dropshippers?
Yes you can, but it makes shipping more complicated.
Are the products from the drop ship suppliers junk and cheaply made?
These are all brand new, straight from the factory products. Some are products that can be placed in a dollar type store, but other products are more for boutique high end stores.
Do you have a hot list of products so we can start selling right away?
Hot lists are not to be trusted. If you are looking at a hot list, then thousands if not millions of other sellers are looking at that hot list too. That increases the competition on those products, and you can easily be driven out of that product marketplace.
Instructor Biography
Since selling on eBay in 2006, I've grossed over $775,000 in sales. Now, I'm a full-time Udemy instructor earning an average of $4,000 profit per month. (Earnings are proven in section 1 of every course and can be viewed for free).
While (not) studying to become a communication major at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, I was profiting $24,000 per year selling on eBay (that's a lot of beer money).
After college, I moved to an apartment in Boston, MA (that I could barely afford) to create Udemy courses, teaching students how to sell on eBay.
Currently, I'm a top 100 Udemy instructor, teaching people how to emulate my successes on Udemy and eBay. What effectively works for one person will effectively work the same for any other person.

It’s always fun turning the page on a new year. It gives us a chance to audit the past year, to take stock of what worked, what didn’t and what has run its course. After all, to anticipate what’s to come, we can’t lose sight of what’s already come to pass. In 2014, we spent the year celebrating the dawning social employee revolution. This year, we will celebrate the next phase of that revolution: the rise of the social leader.
The idea of the social leader first made splashes late last year, when The Economist Intelligence Unit (@TheEIU), sponsored by IBM (@IBM), released its list of the Top 25 Social Business Leaders. It was my great pleasure to serve on the advisory board charged with determining the list, each member of which is a true social leader in their own right.
So what is a social leader?
In determining our 25 social leaders, the first task was establishing the proper criteria: Social leaders are visionaries, strategic thinkers, culture shapers, storytellers, adaptive, entrepreneurial and fully social. These concepts are bound to mean different things to different people, but I think the best social leaders succeed because they have a clear idea of what these concepts mean to them, and how they can be used to distinguish themselves in business communities.
But what do these terms mean to me, and why do I think recognizing social leaders is so important? I addressed these questions in greater detail in a discussion with The Economist, but ultimately, I think it comes down to this: For most modern professionals, our career paths are no longer linear. We generally don’t stay with the same company all our lives, nor do we always occupy the same roles. If we are to maintain control of our professional destinies, we must work not only to demonstrate our value, but also to demonstrate our engagement in communities relevant to our fields.
Where we’ve been—and where we’re going
Of course, it’s important to understand that social leadership is a journey. You don’t just decide to become a social leader and transform overnight. By its very nature, social engagement is an ongoing process of knowledge sharing and community building.
Just ask social business guru Tom Peters (@tom_peters), whose concept of “BrandYou” nearly 20 years ago was the blueprint for what we consider social leadership today. Simply put, our behaviors determine how our professional communities see us. By taking control of this narrative, we not only empower ourselves in our own careers, but we also help raise the profile and value of both our coworkers and our parent brand.
This conversation is ongoing, with many others championing Peters’s cause and adding their own insights to the process. And according to Kevin Randall (@KevinBrandall), Vice President, Strategy & Planning at Movéo, and New York Times writer, the release of The Social Employee (McGraw-Hill, 2013), co-written by Mark Burgess (@MNBurgess) and myself, has helped to amplify that message.
Of course, we couldn’t have helped to spread the fire if Kevin wasn’t there to fan the flames. The insights offered in his stellar afterword for The Social Employee were spot-on, and his continued evangelism on the subject offers a powerful model of what social leadership is all about.
Spreading the fire
So what does the future have in store for social leaders and social employees? Join me, Mark Burgess and Kevin Randall for an IBM Twitter Chat on Thursday, Feb. 12, at 1 p.m., ET. Here are all the details:
my pronouns are it / its + they / them / their + he / him / his. you can use neutral or traditionally masculine language to refer to me, including language referring to me as a thing. pronouns are in order of preference, though generally i don't care which you use.
i'm mixed-race (filipino, japanese, white) and gray-aromantic asexual. i also identify as bi. i am 15. i am an artist. i am also an abuse survivor, so i will talk about abuse sometimes. expect talk of social issues.
as for fandom-related stuff, i will talk about video games and not much else. it's generally "whatever i'm playing right now" that comes up, which changes from month to month.
i am autistic and have anxiety, depression and ADHD. these will come up rather frequently as well.
Classics don’t become classics overnight. That distinction is earned over time. Whether it’s a striking silhouette or a popular color scheme, it takes years—and sometimes, longer—to earn the love of the community. The latest Air Max 1 unites two classics—the Air Max 1 and black-and-red colorway—to create a fresh expression of modern sport style.
Once constructed in mesh and suede for maximum performance, the Air Max 1 is now equipped for everyday life with a premium leather upper. Its premium upper arrives in the familiar combination of black and red, displayed in the same color blocking utilized by that unforgettable model introduced in 1985. A final nod to 1985—the year black-and-red footwear made its way to the court—is included with an embossed Nike Air logo on the lateral heel.
You never forget your first love. The new Air Max 1 arrives February 9 on nike.com/sportswear and at select retailers.
Over 30% people prefer shorter life than taking daily pills for heart diseases, reveals new study
A new study has found that over 30% people are afraid of taking pills daily to prevent heart diseases and rather opt for a shorter life.
Image for representational purposes only.
A new study has found that over 30% people are afraid of taking pills daily to prevent heart diseases and rather opt for a shorter life.
The study conducted by American Heart Association analysed people with an average age of 50 and established that more than 8% of people were willing to trade almost two years of their life to avoid taking daily medication for cardiovascular disease, whereas 21% would trade between one week and a year of their lives.
In addition to people who were ready to keep their lives at stake, there were around 21% of people who said they would pay $1,000 or more to avoid taking a pill each day for the rest of their lives.
There were around 70% of participants who were not interested to trade any weeks of their lives to avoid taking a CVD pill daily, and 62% weren't willing to gamble any risk of immediate death.
Robert Hutchins, MD, MPH, lead author said that the act of having pills on daily basis can have a large effect on an individual's quality of life, and even a small reductions in quality of life like those found in this study, can have very large effects on the cost-effectiveness of that drug for a population.
The study is published in Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes journal of American Heart Association.

WWE News: NXT Superstar Kalisto To Debut As A Gay Hair Stylist On Main Roster?
In WWE’s history, superstars have portrayed a wide variety of gimmicks. Some are well-received by the WWE Universe, while others are put on the metaphorical shelf of distaste. For example, Leo Kruger, in NXT, came to the WWE’s main roster as Adam Rose. At first, the crowd popped for him, because he was different. Over time, that faded away, and now Rose is a jobber for WWE.
Rose is a guy who had a great gimmick in NXT, but the WWE Creative team changed it. Adrian Neville, who is rumored to be coming up to the main roster, might get a gimmick change. Instead of having no gimmick while being over with the NXT crowd, WWE wants to have him portray a “Mighty Mouse” gimmick.
So far, the WWE fans online don’t care for the idea. However, that time has not come yet, so there’s time to change their minds if need be.
The next man to get called up after Neville is Kalisto. He just dropped the NXT Tag-Team titles to Blake and Murphy last week. Upon his call-up to Raw and Smackdown, Kalisto is rumored to get a new gimmick. According to Reddit user MetsFan4Ever, Kalisto might get a new gimmick that will garner a unique reaction from the WWE Universe.
He reports that WWE is looking for a new masked star to take over with Rey Mysterio likely leaving but NXT officials recently tried Kalisto out with a new, unmasked gimmick – that of a gay hair stylist.
Kalisto reportedly did very well in the role and is seriously being considered to do that gimmick instead of continuing with the Kalisto character.
Now, if the WWE decides to keep this gimmick on Kalisto, then they will certainly be prepared for the different responses from the WWE Universe. The last time a WWE superstar portrayed a gay, or lesbian, character was during the early 2000s, when Chuck Palumbo and Billy Gunn teased a relationship. That was also in the TV-14 era of WWE programming.
It is 2015, and the WWE has been public about a good relationship with the “NOH8″ campaign that went viral last year. Many big names within WWE such as Stephanie McMahon, Triple H, Daniel Bryan, and Batista joined the LGBT community for equality.
WWE is also known for supporting GLAAD on their Spirit Day by going all-out in purple for the cause. It’s been more prevalent since Darren Young, WWE superstar, announced he was gay two years ago.
The big question on everyone’s minds is how the WWE Universe will act upon Kalisto’s rumored gimmick. Everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion, and perhaps WWE will test it out at house shows first. We’ll keep you updated on this story as it develops.
4 Responses to “WWE News: NXT Superstar Kalisto To Debut As A Gay Hair Stylist On Main Roster?”
I think this would just be another big mistake from wwe. There current content is crap enough. This isn't about being gay or not but he has a good thing going as kalisto. If they change him he will likely end up like Adam rose a early to mid card jobber being outshone by a bunny. It be better to use Darren young in this gimmick. He is gay and would therefor be more beleiveable. People's sexuality doesn't concern me and is none of my buisness but I feel if they feel a need to do a gimmick like this bring in or use some e who is gay to play the gimmick. Kalistos career is at stake here. These early months in the main roster career make or break them as either the next beak it superstar or at once talented guy wrestler stuck with jobber status

The three Ws are: What are you currently reading? What did you recently finish reading? What do you think you’ll read next?
I am currently reading:
Artemis Fowl I am reading on my own and Time’s Edge I am listening to the audiobook at work. I always have a book I read on my own and then a book that I listen to while working.
I recently finished reading:
Since it is a new month, I am just going to use what I finished this month. I just finished Timebound yesterday and I actually loved it more than I thought I would.
The books I think I’ll read next:
This month I decided to finally get around to reading the books I started and never finished. I started Lost in Babylon about SIX months ago and just stopped reading it, so I really want to finish that book. I also recently bought Yes Please and want to read that next because I have been dying to read it. I read a few pages of it, but decided to hold off on it until I finished the books I got from the library. I haven’t found the audiobook I’m gonna listen to next.

February is considered heart and stroke awareness month by the American Heart Association.
According to the association, heart disease is the number one killer of women. Prevention can be as simple as keeping regular doctor’s appointments and making healthy life choices.
The association recommends following a low-fat and high-fiber diet. It also recommends at least 150 minutes of physical exercise per week.
Another tip is to learn how to manage stress and take care of yourself.
I have always taken a healthy approach to life, especially since I have had congenital heart disease since birth. In the recent years I have become more self-aware due to having a successful heart valve replacement surgery.
The key to good health is to be mindful, which is the practice of being aware of our mind, body and surroundings. This involves feeling the effects of our actions from eating to exercise.
I have always practiced mindfulness to stay connected to myself since it helps guide me through everyday life. To keep myself mindful I meditate every morning to keep me focused and connected.
Every day I practice vinyasa yoga, connecting breath with movement. It is a great way to work out that leaves me feeling healthy and energized.
I also include a Pilates and ballet session to help tone my body. I always enjoy my daily workouts; it is my favorite time and activity of the day.
Another important component to being healthy is eating in moderation. Practicing mindfulness can help determine what foods to eat, when we’re hungry and how much to eat.

Real-time Web Apps with Volt in Ruby
Volt is a slick, new Ruby web framework that aims to blur the line between client and server code. The basic idea behind the framework is that you can write your client-side code (which is usually Javascript) in Ruby using Opal, a Ruby runtime within Javascript. In addition, Volt provides some nice ways to relay data between the client-side and the server-side. If you’ve used Meteor before, Volt is a very similar idea, but there are many portions of Meteor which Volt doesn’t have. I think Volt has some real potential. As web apps become more and more client-side heavy, it is a pain to have to switch mental context between Javascript and Ruby. It’s even more of a pain to figure out how to flow simple pieces of data between the client and server. Volt can help you get there quickly.
In this article, I’ll go through how to build an incredibly simple bookmark “app” with Volt. The point of this article is to get you up to speed with some of the very basics and to get you a feel for how the client/server divide works in Volt. Let’s get to it.
Views
First of all, we need a copy of Volt:
gem install volt
If you’ve used Rails before, then you’ll find some of the “volt” command line arguments pretty familiar. Here’s how we create a new project:
volt new volt-example
You should see a familiar-looking (if you’re a Rails kind of person) directory layout:
Gemfile Gemfile.lock README.md app config config.ru lib spec
To see what Volt has already set up for us, fire up the web server:
bundle exec volt server
You should see something like this:
Alright, so where is this page generated, exactly? If you go into the app directory, you should see a “main” directory. Unlike Rails, Volt lets you break your webapp up into “components” (this idea is similar to the Django style of separation). It automatically defines the “main” component for you, so let’s head into that directory. You now see:
assets config controllers models tasks views
If you peek in views/main, you can see the views associated with this component. The layout for the views that are part of this component is defined in main.html which looks like:
The odd looking , , etc. are a pretty integral part of how views work in Volt. Basically, if you see a tag in the form (note the capitalized first letter), it is defining or utilizing a section. In the layout, we are defining three sections: , and which include some basic layout and then defer to the template of the action we have called. Specifically, these are the two lines that call the action templates:
In Volt, wherever we have some code enclosed by {{ and }}, it is executed as Ruby using Opal. In this case, we’re using some of the variables available in order to pull up the template appropriate for the page using this layout. Alright, let’s look at one of these templates. Open up app/main/views/main/about.html:
<:Title> About <:Body> <h1>About</h1> <p>About page...</p>
That looks pretty simple! Basically, we’re just filling in the sections in the layout. Let’s jump back to the template to examine it a bit more closely. You might notice that some of tags are in the form (note the lowercase first letter). These are not sections; they are controls. In a sense, they are like Rails’ template helpers (e.g. link_to) since they help you generate some HTML. We’ll see some more of those as we continue.
Routes and Adding a View
Alright, that’s enough knowledge for the timebeing. Let’s get started building our bookmarking app. We’ll need one page where the user can see the list of bookmarks and add a new one. We’ll deal with the functionality as we move along, but first, create a new view and a route to go with it. Creating a view is simple; just create the file app/main/views/main/bookmarks.html:
<:Title> Bookmarks <:Body> <h1>Bookmarks</h1>
To add the route, we go over to config/routes.rb and the following line:
get '/bookmarks', _action: 'bookmarks'
Annnd, that’s it! You’ll have to restart the server (the author of Volt says that soon you won’t have to do this) and then you should see a nice page at localhost:3000/bookmarks. In fact, we can make the bookmarks action the index by changing the last line of config/routes.rb to the following:
get '/', {_action: 'bookmarks'}
Another neat thing about Volt is that it gives you automatic page reloads. If you try changing the contents of app/main/views/main/bookmarks.html and then save the file, you will be able to see the page reload in the browser.
The Basic Pieces
Le’ts figure out how to process a form so that we can actually create new bookmarks. Subsequently, we want to display these bookmarks nicely on a page. Before we do that, it is incredibly important to understand a fundamental difference between Volt and Rails. Volt is a sort of MVVM (Model View, View Model)) framework, not an MVC framework. In practical terms, the view in Volt calls on the controller to get stuff done, not the other way around.
First of all, we need a form. That’s pretty easy, just add the following to the of bookmarks.html:
Alright, some parts of this code are run-of-the-mill, others aren’t. We have what seems like a simple form element. However, it has some weird attributes, e.g. e-submit. Here, e-submit = "add_bookmark" is telling Volt that the add_bookmark method/action in the controller should be called when data in this form is submitted. The other two weird lines are:
We are defining text input elements but the magic happens in the value field. Within the value = "..." attribute, we are creating a binding. When the value of those text elements change, the values of the variables page._new_bookmark._description and page._new_bookmark._url will change. At this point, this form will do nothing important since we haven’t really put anything in the add_bookmark controller action. So, open up app/main/controllers/main_controller.rb and the add the following as a method:
In Volt, this thing called page is a model. It isn’t a model in the Rails sense of the word – it doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with your database. Instead, a model is a piece of data that the frontend and backend can both get. Remember that Volt is not just a server-side Ruby framework (such as Rails or Sinatra). The point of Volt is that it lets the client-side and server-side interoperate pretty seamlessly.
Back to page. In the form, we’ve bound the variables page._new_bookmark._description and page._new_bookmark._url (notice the underscores prepending the variable names; using those automatically gives us empty models to put data in) to certain form values. In the controller code, we can take these variables and use them! Update them in the view and the changes to those variables are available in the controller. This might not seem all that magical at first glance, but the power of the idea comes from the fact that you could create a model of any kind in the client and then expect it to show up when you call controller code from the view.
The controller then takes page._bookmarks and puts a Ruby hash inside with what represents the data associated with one bookmark in our simple webapp. Before we can see the results of our efforts, we need to have a bit of code in the view that displays these bookmarks:
Alrighty, head over to “localhost:3000″, you’ll see a pretty plain looking form where you can enter a description and a URL, hit enter, and see it appear in the list of bookmarks just below.
Persistence
If you refresh your page after inputting some of those bookmarks, you’re in for a nasty suprise: they probably all just vanished. We need some way to persist that information.
Persistence is really easy in Volt, but it does come with a gotcha: Volt currently only supports MongoDB if you want to use the client-server-sharing magic. You might ask why Volt doesn’t support something more “standard”, like Postgres or MySQL. The problem is that translating JSON objects to and from multiple SQL tables is quite a headache and we’d need an ORM in the middle. Essentially, Volt is part of the camp that believes that having that sort of a translationary ORM within a web framework is a bad idea.
If you don’t have a copy of Mongo, it’s pretty easy to get. On Mac OS X:
brew install mongodb mongod
If you’re on Linux, for our purposes, using the version of Mongo available in your distribution’s package manager should be fine. With Windows, I’ve found this guide helpful.
If you head over to db/config/app.rb, you;ll find the following lines commented out:
Just bring them back into existence. We’ll need to create a model for our bookmarks. Since “models” in Volt aren’t really connected to a “CREATE TABLE” SQL command, we don’t really have to specify much. We just have to create the file app/main/models/bookmark.rb and drop in:
class Bookmark < Volt::Model end
Your database setup is ready to go after a restart of the Volt server. We do, however, need to change our view and controller a bit. Remember the page._bookmarks array we were putting our bookmarks into? In order to make that sync into MongoDB, we just have to change page._bookmarks to _bookmarks. Volt will handle the rest.
That’s it! Notice how easily we are getting data from the browser to Mongo. However, there are a few issues with this approach. This idea of database syncing between the client and server came into fashion with Meteor. However, Meteor takes the client-server connection a step further with a completely client-side implementation of Mongo. In addition, Meteor lets your app listen for changes in collections on the server and get them pushed directly to the client database. This stuff isn’t part of Volt, as far as one can tell from the existing documentation. So, Volt’s persistence support isn’t quite as powerful as that of Meteor when it comes to real-time applications with live data updates.
That’s a Wrap!
We’ve only scratched the very surface of Volt. In fact, our bookmark manager looks a bit…garbage. But, we’ve come far enough to give you a taste of what the basic idea of Volt is: closer and easier integration between the client and server.
Free JavaScript: Novice to Ninja Sample
Thanks for the article on volt One thing, in your demo code, when you change to using store, you need to either reference store directly in the views:
store._bookmarks
or you need to set the controllers model to be :store
class MainController < Volt::ModelController model :store ... end
Also, Volt has realtime updates like Meteor. We do things a bit different implementation, but the end result is the same, updates are pushed to clients and the DOM updates when the data changes. Let me know if there's anything I can help clarify.
Thanks for the compliments. I had the controller model setting in my code but didn't include it in the article - I'll get it changed right away.
The point I was making about Meteor was just pointing out the differing implementation; as far as I know, Volt does not have a small implementation of MongoDB running in the browser. I can reword it to make that more clear.
@alpop If you add the "http://" at the beginning of the url string, that should enter it correctly. Otherwise, it is rendered as a local, relative path which is why it opens as "localhost:3000/www.google.com/".

It's known as the Bayou city...) riding sport bikes, the occasional windsurfing, and never ending battle of the bulge and trying to get in shape. I used to be a bodybuilder back in the 80's and it kind of fizzled from there...8)
I have worked in a lot of different fields ranging from pizza delivery driver to cook, to teaching English as a foreign language, teaching Greek, Interpeter, selling ladie's shoes, private security, bodyguard, delivery driver, etc.... Something about working for someone else though has never agreed with me. I guess you can't fire yourself, that why I like to work for myself. 8)
I speak fluent Greek, a bit of Spanish which I learned from ex wife's family, a little German, and you can catch my accent when I mispronounce words like sheets and sheep.... I'll let you guess what sheet sounds like when I pronounce it...8)
In my line of work (massage therapy) I've learned to replace sheets with linens. Cuts down on stunned looks. 8)
