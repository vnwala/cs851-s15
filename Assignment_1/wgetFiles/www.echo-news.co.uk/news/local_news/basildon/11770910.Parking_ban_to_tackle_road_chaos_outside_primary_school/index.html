  Fed-up residents are celebrating after the parking problems around a school look set to be tackled.
</p>
<p>
  The South Essex Parking Partnership intends to ban parking on one side of the road near Hilltop Infant and Junior School, <a href="http://www.echo-news.co.uk/search/?search=Wickford&amp;topic_id=3474" target="_self">Wickford</a>, to stop drivers blocking driveways and causing gridlock.
</p>

                <div class="ad inarticle" id="DFP_in_article_mpu"></div>
            
<p>
  Residents complained emergency vehicles have been unable to pass when cars are parked on both sides.
</p>
<p>
  The restrictions, which would be in place from 8.30am to 9.30am and 2.30pm to 4.30pm, would be introduced in Beauchamps Drive, Glencoe Drive, Hill Avenue, Mercury Close and Redgate Close.
</p>
<p>
  In a letter to residents outlining the proposals, South Essex Parking Partnership confirmed it was taking actions after resident complaints about inappropriate parking.
</p>
<p>
  Nigel Le Gresley, county and borough councillor for Wickford, has been lobbying for restrictions to be brought in.
</p>
<p>
  He said: “If people would park sensibly, we wouldn’t need any controls at all, because it is only common sense.
</p>
<p>
  “You can’t get an ambulance or a fire engine through if cars are on both sides.
</p>
<p>
  “With what is being proposed, if you stop at all, you are liable to get a penalty notice, whereas before there was a period of time you had to be there before it could be issued. Residents in the area deserve some relief from the problems and this is a way of doing it.”
</p>
                <div class="articleInsert clearfix">
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                </div>
                
<p>
  Last year, PCSOs from Wickford police station patrolled the area and handed out fines to offending drivers.
</p>
<p>
  A parking partnership spokesman said: “It is acknowledged the area serves a school and there is a need for schoolrelated traffic to park in the area.
</p>
<p>
  “The proposal will allow parking on one side of the road where it is considered safe to do so and aims to encourage safe, sensible parking in the known congested areas.”
</p>
<p>
  A public consultation period on the proposed restrictions will run from Thursday until February 27.
</p>
